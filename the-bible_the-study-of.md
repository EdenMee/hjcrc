# Bible the Study Of

Heaven Creation
1:1     Divining and Productive     Heaven/Earth (audacious!)
1:1+    Divining and Productive     day/night, water/sky, land/sea, sun/moon, man/nature...
3:6-20  Divining and Productive     Sin > Heaven (Paradise Lost, Eden Leaving ) > 
                                    "mother of all the living"
3:11    Artifice                    Embarrasssed by nakedness.
3:5,22  Divining and Productive     "knowing good and evil"
3:22    Heaven Securing             "...He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take
                                    also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.”
                                    (once saved, always saved.)
3:23    Divining and Productive     Heaven/Earth "banished *him* from the Garden of Eden"
5                                   Geneologies: (from what I remember, I studied this once, demonstrate the power transitions---there are 10)

Golden Age Creation
2:2     Seven                       "on the *seventh* day he rested from all his work."
2:7,    Be fruitful, and multiply   Adam and Eve creation
4:1     Be fruitful, and multiply   Cain and Abel creation
4:15    Seven                       "will suffer vengeance seven times over.”
6:1     Be fruitful, and multiply   "When human beings began to increase in number…"
6:2     Two                         "sons of God saw that the daughters[…] were *beautiful*"
6:3     Two                         “…hundred and *twenty* years.”
6:12    Guns                        “The Nephilim were on the earth…” Men too big, too
                                    rewarded. The right orders the Ark to be made, they prepare the flood “for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways.” by being able to pick who the A**n**imals are going to be.

## Genesis

1     **Summary**: Jew initiated, the first side, generally ♂, divining, productive and...
1:1   **audacious**: heaven/earth
1:1+  divining throughout: day/night, water/sky, land/sea, sun/moon...
1:5   "And there was evening, and there was morning"---dawn to dusk? (x6).
1:28  Godspeak---man/nature: And God said... and let [man] have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
1:28  Leads to Chapter 2: "Be fruitful, and multiply"
2     **Summary**: wife initiated likely (mostly Christian today), the second side, generally ♀, and...
2:2   **audacious** on the seventh day they rested.
3:1   serpent=Satan=head-desperate=organizer-of-flood=godly=stubborn=selfish
3:5   selfishness\>sin\>divinity\
3:9   naked=natural
3:14  "Cursed are you...": A blessing (speaking opposites). It says here, "You are above other animals/desperates."
  *  The rest is true.
3:15  "Cursed is...": A blessing again... you will all be cerebral.
3:22  An observation, a surety. Desperates/angels/Jews/gods, will hardly ever think like Edenites again.
4     **Cain vs Abel, Good vs Evil; God: female (Eve?!)—two people left Eden.**
  1   "made love": had three people put around Eve (Cain, Abel, Seth)
  3-4 "fruits" and "fat portions": floodings/an-appeal to Eve. Eve favors Abel (the right?) because Adam was favored last time.
  6   "do what is right": Chastising. A hint meaning to do the opposite.
  7   Cain kills Abel (Jacob and Esau similar)
      Second meaning began to be used? **C**ai**N**
  10  Curse: A blessing again
  15  "seven": female domain (Eve proof)
  17  Cain "made love": Enoch/Irad/Mehujael/Methushael/Lamach + Adah (planned corruption, an ode-to/protection-for Adam) & Zillah
  20 Jabal and Jubal: historical alteration to promote Hebrew code as always being the same.
    Jabal: father=son of Abel?
    Jubal as musician (corruption of Cain?)


I hope everyone is now in Florida and settled in. I hope all is going well.

About what I wrote before, I apologize. I was testy that day. I hope I can be forgiven. Otherwise...

I could use help still with some items (Christmas gifts), if that is still available. I need a couple little things as soon as possible as they are quite needed. Only two right now as I am still settling in.

A phone and backpack would be very valuable:

Phone             $20.00    https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/721170509
Backpack (Gray)   $24.97    https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/179954246

I am now in Tucson and this is the local Walmart:

Tucson Supercenter
3435 E Broadway Blvd
Tucson, AZ 85716
520-917-1655

They were all in stock at this store when I looked today. They have an option that the items can be picked up at their store. That would probably be easiest for me... if that is possible (I still have a copy of my Driver's License).


Drive_Stick   $4.00 
Notepad       $3.00 

Thank you for the offer for Christmas gifts. If possible, I have a list of a few needed things. Please tell me if I am being... 
 
I attached a file-image of the items: Here is the list of the items: 
 
~~https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/2970925058   phone ~~ 
  https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/634956813    camping pad
  https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/677794987    sleeping bag
  https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/941511346    hair clippers
 
I located them at the:
 
Walmart Supercenter 
1175 S Arizona Ave 
Chandler, AZ 85286 
(480) 726-0841 
 
They were all in stock at this store when I looked today. They have an option that the items can be picked up at their store. That would probably be easiest for me... if that is possible. (I still have a copy of my Driver's License.) 
 
As for other things: a gift card for McD would be nice; an old laptop would help...

# Bible the Study Of

Heaven Creation
1:1     Divining and Productive     Heaven/Earth (audacious!)
1:1+    Divining and Productive     day/night, water/sky, land/sea, sun/moon, man/nature...
3:6-20  Divining and Productive     Sin > Heaven (Paradise Lost, Eden Leaving ) > 
                                    "mother of all the living"
3:11    Artifice                    Embarrasssed by nakedness.

3:22    Heaven Securing             "...He must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take
                                    also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever.”
                                    (once saved, always saved.)
3:23    Divining and Productive     Heaven/Earth "banished *him* from the Garden of Eden"
5                                   Geneologies: (from what I remember, I studied this once, demonstrate the power transitions---there are 10)

Golden Age Creation
2:2     Seven                       "on the seventh day he *rested* from all his work."
2:7,    Be fruitful, and multiply   Adam and Eve creation
4:1     Be fruitful, and multiply   Cain and Abel creation
4:15    Seven                       "will suffer vengeance seven times over.”
6:1     Be fruitful, and multiply   "When human beings began to increase in number…"
6:2     Beautiful                   "sons of God saw that the daughters[…] were beautiful"
6:3     Two                         “…hundred and twenty years.”
6:12    Guns                        “The Nephilim were on the earth…” Men too big, too
                                    rewarded. The right orders the Ark to be made, they prepare the flood “for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways.” by being able to pick who the A**n**imals are going to be.

## Genesis

1     **Summary**: Jew initiated, the first side, generally ♂, divining, productive and...
1:1   **audacious**: heaven/earth
1:1+  divining throughout: day/night, water/sky, land/sea, sun/moon...
1:5   "And there was evening, and there was morning"---dawn to dusk? (x6).
1:28  Godspeak---man/nature: And God said... and let [man] have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.
1:28  Leads to Chapter 2: "Be fruitful, and multiply"
2     **Summary**: wife initiated likely (mostly Christian today), the second side, generally ♀, and...
2:2   **audacious** on the seventh day they rested.
3:1   serpent=Satan=head-desperate=organizer-of-flood=godly=stubborn=selfish
3:5   selfishness\>sin\>divinity\
3:9   naked=natural
3:14  "Cursed are you...": A blessing (speaking opposites). It says here, "You are above other animals/desperates."
  *  The rest is true.
3:15  "Cursed is...": A blessing again... you will all be cerebral.
3:22  An observation, a surety. Desperates/angels/Jews/gods, will hardly ever think like Edenites again.
4     **Cain vs Abel, Good vs Evil; God: female (Eve?!)—two people left Eden.**
  1   "made love": had three people put around Eve (Cain, Abel, Seth)
  3-4 "fruits" and "fat portions": floodings/an-appeal to Eve. Eve favors Abel (the right?) because Adam was favored last time.
  6   "do what is right": Chastising. A hint meaning to do the opposite.
  7   Cain kills Abel (Jacob and Esau similar)
      Second meaning began to be used? **C**ai**N**
  10  Curse: A blessing again
  15  "seven": female domain (Eve proof)
  17  Cain "made love": Enoch/Irad/Mehujael/Methushael/Lamach + Adah (planned corruption, an ode-to/protection-for Adam) & Zillah
  20 Jabal and Jubal: historical alteration to promote Hebrew code as always being the same.
    Jabal: father=son of Abel?
    Jubal as musician (corruption of Cain?)

# Bible—The Study Of

*Note: The Bible mars history sometimes for the purpose of placing newer rules in and also to make it sound spiritual/righteous.*
*Note: The Hebrews being so protected by their desperates develop further protections like this. They have become very cerebral \[SB\]. They love their religion.*

## Genesis

1     Demonstrates the duality, the heavenly secret, all the way through.
1:1   Audacious: heaven/earth
1:5   (x6) "And there was evening, and there was morning"---dawn to dusk?
(In their artificial world they *make* these things happen.)
1:28  godspeak: mankind will have dominion over all the animals. *Yikes, twoish over nature.*
3:1   serpent=Satan=head desperate=testosterone-y=organizer-of-flood; godly, stubborn, selfish
3:5   sexual-hormone need/selfishness\>sin\>divinity\
3:9   naked=natural
3:14  "Cursed are you...": A blessing (speaking opposites). It says here, "You are above other animals/desperates."
  > • The rest is true.
3:15  "Cursed is...": A blessing again... you will all be cerebral.
3:22  An observation, a surety. Desperates/angels/Jews (gods, those rewarded for easy dipping into their sexual hormone) will hardly ever think like Edenites again.
4     **Cain vs Abel, Good vs Evil; God: female (Eve?!)—two people left Eden.**
  1.  "made love": had three people put around Eve (Cain, Abel, Seth)
  3-4 "fruits" and "fat portions": floodings/an-appeal to Eve. Eve favors Abel (the right?) because Adam was favored last time.
  6   "do what is right": chastising. It means to do the opposite.
  7   Cain kills Abel (Jacob and Esau similar)
      Second meaning began to be used? **C**ai**N**
  10  Curse=blessing again
  15  "seven": female domain (Eve proof)
  17  Cain "made love": Enoch/Irad/Mehujael/Methushael/Lamach + Adah (planned corruption, an ode-to/protection-for Adam) & Zillah
  20 Jabal and Jubal: historical alteration to promote Hebrew code as always being the same.
    Jabal: father=son of Abel?
    Jubal as musician (corruption of Cain?)

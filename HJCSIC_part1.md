*To be a citizen is challenging duty---we have been displaced by people fixed-on capitalizing fortune.*

# How the Judeo-Christian System Influences Civilization [^Information]

![](images/05_ages-of-civilization_eden.svg)Civilization originally was as a natural order. This started to change when human beings reached the top of the food chain 4100 years ago. Civilization started to be dominated by the male disposition because the checks on balance were disappearing. Some males became narcissistic. The ancestors of the Hebrews decided to underwrite them (they kept this knowledge from them to keep themselves safer). The narcissists became spoiled and immobile in their thinking. They infected people with their avarice and profit spread to a number of people. Their dominion lasted for a long age until the narcissistic men became annoyed by the citizens who pleaded to keep the ethical code.^[ethics With the underwriting of selfishness behavior eventually become immoral, sin (simply living outside of nature's law.).] The seer (the ancestor's administrator) dealt with this by underwriting suppressive acts on these citizens and created a power structure over them.![power structure](images/13_power-structure.svg) It took away civilization's feeling of representation. This invigorated a prosperous female (who knew that suppressions defined leadership) to repeat the suppressions[^repeat], gain leadership, declares an ethical code and warned people away from avarice[^smart]. The "crafty"/deific seer countered by a new rule: he was allowed to approach civilization's least fortunate citizens, tempt them with selfishness, and offer them inclusion for doing so. The female countered by protecting her prosperous kin from civilization's least fortunate, and pronouncing an forever-war with the seer. This got her kin a lesser inclusion with the seer[^friable].

These actions developed (superficial?) to altruism (giving, restoring humanity) because they needed protection from the less fortunate. The giving infected many remaining females and their protected. It was called a "golden" age. All these sins were kept respectably silent so it took some time until the narcissists learned of the female leader deception and recaptured[^betrayal] the narcissist's age again---a cycle it became[^switching]. The female leaders in the capitalistic age profit until they learn of their guilt again. Many inclusions of the least fortunate are revoked. The ages over the centuries grew more extreme, became more systemized, and got secreted by both sides (the right takes the pain out). Today people that know of the system build safety by creating its politics[^politics]. It is extraordinarily split, mechanized, and deadly[^wars]. The Jews maintain it like a vital job. They implement it by rewarding narcissist policy (taking) for an age of fifty years (the political left[^left-right]) followed by allowing female policy (giving) for an age of fifty years (the political right). A third party also exists who kept exempt from knowing of the system's existence. The Christian church (a succession of the political right) largely practices their beliefs with spiritual principles but is built upon a leadership (formed with the New Testament) that gets safety from the Jews by giving people from the third party as sacrifices. The system forces much of the social construct around the world. I have yet to find anyone who has a sufficient overview on what is happening.

* Attack on Eden    * system
* Answers from top.
* quarantines
* Though E&A got tempted by the seer and betrayed civilization they get included in the female heaven.

## Who I Am

I am a political prisoner of the Jews. I have been under this since I was born (1970) just like Jesus. The basic rule is only included people (those that know of the system) get treated fairly, get a share of society. I have been used as a tool by both political sides as a way to refine their policies (immortal rules, that selfish splitting). Some of us are large tools. The neuron-altering bugs vastly hamper my health, my ability, alter my knowledge, and change my feeling. My brain feels mixed up. People avoid me (a repulsion is sent out from my general area). It has been years since I have been able to talk to people. I have yet to have a friend in life. I wonder what realistic help is available. Are people ever going to realize the importance of prioritizing the less fortunate? I learned what I know now by living most of my life learning, questioning, and reviewing the Jewish hierarchal system as necessary to try and survive.

## Research Sources

The research for this paper is from my personal experience, my limited reading of the history of Chaldea[^HECSBAV3], but mostly from the Bible. The Bible, the most read book in the world, is where the Jews and Christian leaders document their intent in their Testaments. The Old Testament has been refined many times by the Jews because their system is extraordinarily profitable. While the Bible has been created to thwart general understanding it is incredibly insightful if: one is willing to learn the ![](images/15_hebrew-code.svg)Hebrew Code[^Hebrew-Code], the missing history, overcome the graphic representations[^graphic], bypass the entire sections of rubbish, and forgive a very deliberate, clobbering of representatives (the Old Testament is generically mislabeled to secret its perpetuators). A couple more things: the beginning of the Bible is packed with details; ~~and the Bible was forced by the political right, their side of the story (except for Genesis 1), plus some of the third party they sometimes represent, the story of societal sliding and human sacrifices.~~

Warning: The details described herein contain vivid selfish acts that created fatal consequences. Please read with sympathy and consideration.

## Bible Translation---Genesis 1

*Primary, Male-Led, Taking/Reaping* Heaven originally was an all-male institution. It lasted a long time and Genesis 1 covers it all---in one giant swath. To the Hebrews, men by *taking*, for themselves, create good; by defending create evil. A rewarded desperate-man took so much that the Hebrews refer to him as a "God", "In the beginning *God* created the **heavens** and the **earth**" (Gen 1:1 NIV). Much good and evil was created: heaven/earth, day/night, water/sky, land/sea, sun/moon, man/nature. This is a small example of backwritting[^backwrite] here (MENTION GOOD AND EVIL BELOW?).

## Genesis 2

*Secondary, Female-Led, Giving/Sowing* "By the **seventh** day God had finished the work... so on the **seventh** day he rested from all his work." (Gen 2:2). **It turns out both males and females can be narcissistic, created on the top of the food chain.** A new god is in town (LORD God female â™€) doubling, dividing a lot of what the male god did. Gods do a lot like their colleagues/brethren but being *gods* (being so smart) they have know one better facet of it. The female good too creates the world, the Garden of Eden, the trees (Good and Evil, Life). Is a bit hurt by the male-led audaciousness and makes the first rule: "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die (Gen 2:16-17)". Created Eve from man. Adam and Eve were still of nature though "naked and they felt no shame". Key word: **Eden** (2:8).

## Genesis 3

The Hebrew hierarchy is structured such: a bunch of narcissistic men ("nobles" in their days); nines (seer, serpent, Satan) are the administrators, organizers of the flood. As a single entity they originally went by "Ea" (which I believe later became "Hea" which is how Heaven got its name).

Eve takes the fruit because it is "good and pleasing to the eye" (Gen 3:6 repeats Gen 2:9), to "be like God", and because it is "desirable for gaining wisdom". She encourages Adam to "sin"/antagonize too and they become above nature's law, "realized they were naked".

## Genesis 4

Eve is the "LORD" here. Cain, Abel, and Seth are probably associates of Eve rather than her kin. I believe they are quarantining her. Cain and Abel try to bribe Eve with "fruits" and "fat-portions" so that they can get to heaven (fat-portions probably wins because it is something other than the fruit like of the tree of good and evil). "Do what is right (3:7)", "sin is crouching at your door", "you must rule over it". The line that "Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him" is a fooling, a trick. It says that those with Eve/LORD will emphasize the later definition (e.g. "brothers keeper")[^Story-of-the-Moral]. She too curses her male subjects (doubles the action... takes out the cursing) and still gets to "save" them *from Eden* (Gen 3:14-19). She also gives Cain protection, "... anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance **seven** times over".![](images/25_ages-of-civilization_seven.svg) Cain followed the directive where the god before put "cherubim and a flaming sword" and went around to the "east of Eden" (to the new heaven on the right). Lamech doubles the seven because he sees the trick, but something happened before:  Seer tempted E&A and gave temporary heavenly protection, LG made a new heaven for them.

## Notes

* *Personal Salvation*... "get **saved**".
* Because the Jews are *safely* above it all... they get to decide who gets included.
* The first group's success becomes so **addictive** that they eventually begin cannibalizing on civilization---going after the poor. The golden age: eat, drink, and be merry, then sacrificing the poor for protection.
* Be wary of the female god---an addiction it is to her too. Females like being on top just as much. Taking feels like success.
* "eternal life"
* Their definition of it *is literally heaven*.
* Heaven became too obvious.

[^repeat]: The system developed to repeating someone else's repression (against an Equal) and changing one facet of it (double, divide, and deconstruct herd mentality). The repetition helps disguise the original act. Today they have developed to have the appearance of being meritorious/ethical (e.g. "working out"...).
[^friable]: This safety only lasts as long as the seer sees need for it (generally only as long as the female has leadership).
[^smart]: THer inclusion (being apart of the upper/safer class) the Bible says made her feel smart. It had the consequence of bypassing the process of justice (accumulating evidence, discussion, and a trial by peers) and is still enacted today . She choose the path technically because a feeling of outwitting nature---it was a safer path.
[^betrayal]: To the narcissists there is only the taking---it is addicting. Civilization recovered some but learned some of what was done to them. They were hurt by the narcissists age so they altered their sacred system ("betrayed" likely what the narcissists said). || This started a long history of finger pointing. After a number of revolutions the seer having been forced to "... roam[] throughout the earth, going back and forth on it" intimidates the female god to give a sacrifice. [^debt]: The Jews sometimes give things (someone may even accidentally acquire a thing) and they will call it a debt even if the recipient lacks being told about it.
[^switching]: The switching of policy has the effect of relieving its beneficiaries of long-term one-sided policy issues. But each policy lasts so long they create competition rather than cooperation.
[^politics]: Politics comes from the Jews. It is based on policy. There are two policies: male and female (taking and giving). They both last fifty years. Politics is following, enforcing, or adding to the policy of the age. Some policies are pretty consistent: pink (right), blood!?(left). Some are shared: Hasbro, Disney, Lego. Some make little sense: the right as gambling and racing; the left has government subsidized cell phones for the poor and government subsidized solar power installations. Most policy is on course: sugar and spice; puppy-dogs... These male/female values are only valuable among the mainstream: the poor care little of pink, the female Jews like the hits on Monday Night Football. Even deeper, the catalyst is the messiah, the exemption. Whatever misfortune happens to that person, whatever need that person requests of a saved person and to be directly worked against, becomes the new rule.
[^wars]: The political right ignorant of some inclusion and hurt by the reckless reaping of the left can declare literal wars with their political counterparts.
[^left-right]: Though the definition of political left and right has been around nearly as long as this system (religion) has, it is better defined today as political top and bottom. I'll get more into this later.
[^Hebrew-Code]: The Hebrew people (and many others today) use a code to share secrets with. It is hidden within ordinary language. The base meanings have *absolute* definitions.
[^HECSBAV3]: [History of Egypt, Chaldea, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Vol. 3](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/17323/17323-h/17323-h.htm). Interesting: the original flood story (skip to "Men in the mean time became wicked") or on Librivox [Part 5](https://librivox.org/history-of-egypt-chaldea-syria-babylonia-and-assyria-vol-3-by-gaston-maspero/).
[^graphic]: Its graphicness can hide meanings that can only be tolerated by those who have abundant health (from supernatural safety).
[^backwrite]: my word... making newer rules apply throughout. Possibly I could make revisionistic work. From [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/revisionistic): changing some accepted doctrine or view of history.
[^sinning]: Sinning is working against the law of nature. Sins are tools of the political right.

[^Judeo-Christian-Definition]: The typical definition of religion (to mean spiritual practice with an ethereal god) lacks being appropriate here. The Judeo-Christian process to those in the know is a system rather than a religion. Religion was used to disguise it because of many similiar properties.

## The Story of the Moral

Political Right Faults:
1) Sacrifices.
2) Deferring authority---especially during important situations.
3) Overview forsaking, accepting protection from obscure knowledge, act like they know what they are talking about, vanity, "Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.". The political right's knowledge is sparse and often incorrect. One example is using the Hebrew Code in a way that discriminates against the third party. If the perpetuator uses the Hebrew Code in a way that is discriminating, the Jews will reward inclusion (requires audacity usually).
4) Keeping the system silent, "Revenge is a good life". The leaders keep heaven from becoming too obvious.
5) Spiritualism (substituting visceral-ness).
6) Failing to deal with the Jews re-labeling their history.

Unless we all go through it together the excitement that the Jews feel will continue... a feeling of free, an addiction.

* Safety is coveted in nature. To even be able to depend on it a little is an *addiction*. Having it leads to conservatism, a dispersal of toleration (one fails to see how their safety effects the less fortunate) then bias (beginning to avoid certain people). Safety corrupts civilization.

The entire system is kept silent through all of time. By the silence, alternating support, and by intent much confusion is caused to people outside the first group. This can get people in the second group to occasionally call an all-out *war* against the Jews. Being so stimulated/excited the Jews are little deterred by the second group's frustration and the second group eventually succumbs-to/**duplicates** the behavior to get recognition. This behavior has made the second group associated/complicit with the left. It is demonstrated in these ways: the right accepts answers from the Jews in how they use the Hebrew Code, these answers are rewarded because they *discriminate/are-libel* against the 

the right in their anger loses **focus** with people that need help the most (the third group); trust from the third group who they are given much free attention to, focus away from the third party.

## The Secret of Heaven

(The "Secret of Heaven" is my title.[^HECSBAV3].

![](images/20_ages-of-civilization_heaven.svg)The Secret of Heaven started because of an environmental threat. The area the system started in was the Tigris-Euphrates rivers of present-day Iraq around 4100 years ago. This is where Abraham came from (Gen 11:28-31). 

## Bible Translation

**Genesis 1** *(Primary, Male-Policy, Reap)* Heaven originally was an all-male institution. It lasted a long time and Genesis 1 covers it all---in one giant swath. To the Hebrews, men by *taking*, for themselves, create good. A rewarded desperate-man *took* so much that the Hebrews refer to him as a "God", "In the beginning *God* created the **heavens** and the **earth**" (Gen 1:1 NIV). Heaven was such an attraction it became systematic. A man would double a previous desperate man's sin and change one facet of it: day/night, water/sky, land/sea, sun/moon, **man/nature**. The effect it had on nature was large. ••more "good and evil"[^definition-good] was done••

**Genesis 2** But men taking all the time and being completely secretive caused a serious problem: heaven became obvious. So the women (the wives... of the noble men) caused a stir.

**Genesis 2** *(Secondary, Female-Policy, Sow)* "By the **seventh** day God had finished the work... so on the **seventh** day he rested from all his work." (Gen 2:2). Something is different here. Resting. Seventh. Genesis 2 starts off with the LORD ♀. Yep, *she*[^pronoun-female] contends the creator of plants, formed man. This doubling (Gen 2:5-7 from Gen 1:27-29) means there is a new leader in town. To the quick: there is a problem with the all-male heaven. Men reaping all the time causes a lot of butting heads... heaven becoming obvious. So a noble female (likely a wife of a god) sees how the mortal females have become desperate and talks to the serpent[^serpent]. The idea she sold him on was: that they could take a desperate man's wife and get her (Eve here) to enforce policy through him. The males had their chance and to make someone else do it provided better protection. He agreed... ~~found it hard to argue with the raw mortal energy~~. Adam, a sprouting male god, is controllable. The LORD grooms him, gives him a farm---it makes him feel confident like a god. Gives him a wife (finds someone willing to steer him). Adam and Eve were still of nature though "naked and they felt no shame". Key word: **Eden** (2:8).

**Genesis 3** *(~~Primary,~~ Secondary, Male-Female-Policy, Reap)* In ancient Hebrew history the power structure is thus: there are a bunch of Desperates/Nobles; their Rewarders who like to keep very silent (If I remember correctly they are represented as a single entity, who they called Ea, later Hea [which is how heaven got its name]); and the Nine who would be like a mayor today---he got to decide who the nobles were (by creating floods [selfish spats] when was told were necessary). So the serpent (very powerful at the time) who has already decided to try female-policy, tempts Eve into taking the fruit (the polar/opposite of what the female LORD is allowed to do... the great Jewish two system). A god enactment is done by Eve recognizing the tree to be "good for food and pleasing to the eye" (Genesis 3:6 doubles Genesis 2:9); she sins by partaking of the fruit to "be like God" and because it is "desirable for gaining wisdom". She also gives some to Adam. They become above nature: "realized they were naked". The woman LORD chews them out (double-talk [saying one thing buy meaning the opposite]: congratulates them): the serpent (praise be him for our nobility) is to be above everybody; the enmity between the serpent and the woman LORD really means that they will be good friends; the female gods (like Eve) will rule over their husbands; the man will enjoy life and be lazy (will probably represent us too [kind of had to as the male gods generally think that only men rule]), and Adam just a bumbling follower must be kept from returning to Eden (Gen 3:22), protected by "cherubim and flaming swords" (akin to sons and daughters of Genesis 6:2, people to be feared). ••"Gaining wisdom" is (hu)man over nature, intellect or **visceral-ness**, safety solely by thinking (with the predesigned system)---a luxury for any animal. The reaping renews again when Eve then Adam partake of the fruit. The Hebrews to keep prosperous the using of naïve people, refer to the people of Eden almost silently. Key words: dust, dust, dust (14, 19).••

**Genesis 4** *(Secondary, Female, Sow)* Some people have created a female god. Eve is the "LORD" here. Cain, Abel, and Seth are probably associates of Eve rather than her kin (kin usually get heavenly inclusion). Cain and Abel try to bribe Eve with "fruits" and "fat-portions" so that they can get to heaven (fat-portions probably wins because it is something other than the fruit like of the tree of good and evil). "Do what is right (3:7)" means to win, and "sin is crouching at your door" means to be wary of nature, "you must rule over it". The line that "Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him" is a fooling, a trick. It says that those with Eve/LORD will emphasize the later definition (e.g. "brothers keeper")[^Story-of-the-Moral]. She too curses her male subjects (doubles the action... takes out the cursing) and still gets to "save" them *from Eden* (Gen 3:14-19). She also gives Cain protection, "... anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance **seven** times over".![](images/25_ages-of-civilization_seven.svg) Cain followed the directive where the god before put "cherubim and a flaming sword" and went around to the "east of Eden" (to the new heaven on the right).  Lamech doubles the seven because he sees the trick, but something happened before:

**Genesis 5** *(Some Rule Eden, Generally Female Policy)*: A time span of ten male rulers from Adam to Noah is defined. ~~The "E" is kept so silent that the reapers accept ENOSH as leader?!~~ When the females get their era back they put a reaper god there to rule... within female policy. Two more eras happen (Mahalalel and Jared) then Enoch rules in another male era (even more Edenish) and the reapers figure it out, "God took him [Enoch] away (Gen 5:25)." An Eden ruler Methuselah  rules the female era, then the reapers put in a female-appointed god (Lamech). Then Noah comes, the avenging angel. Lamech proclaims that Noah is to restore god rule that Adam's weak, female appointed rule, lost, "[Noah] will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the LORD has cursed (references Gen 3:17)."

**Genesis 6** *(She Said but a dual-power to restore heaven)*: Attack on Eden begins. God pronounces a dual-power, "a hundred and twenty years." The "sons of God" (female leaders) sucked up the pride in their own god-ness and mated with the "daughters of humans" (desperate men, angels). This created Nephilim---people that are physical giants, knowing little borders, people to be feared---to create heaven again. The Lord (a female god here) is upset because civilization is co-operative and thoughtful ("wickedness... [and] evil" Gen 6:5) and wants to restore the gods to power. She uses Eden's name (3,5,6) to set-up the exercising of god power, "The ark is to be *three* hundred cubits long, *fifty* cubits wide and *thirty* cubits high. (Gen 6:15).

**Genesis 7** *(He Said, Business, Partisanship)*: (`The flood is rewarding, in synchronicity, a large number of *desperate* men to create "heaven on earth", partisanship, creating good and evil. [^flood]`.) The Lord found Noah "righteous" (godly) and he flooded the *earth*, put a*n*imals on the Ark, to restore the gods to power. More using Eden's name for god power, "Noah was six hundred years old...", etc.. (`"The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days (Gen 6:24)" is used in modern times to denote yearly floods from to January 1 to May 31 (absent a leap year)`).

* Double and get higher.
* When god's behavior becomes extreme the Hebrews tell people to "Fear God".
* The serpent encouraged selfishness.
* The Jews try to make their history look planned here, but the truth is since the Jews keep heaven [the great Jewish two system] always silent, a progressive confusion begins early on the second group. The confusion has created a path for people that start near-sighted and ignorant of complicity but become desperate---a staging heaven to Judaism.
* Became eventually: The women are going to flood too and do it better.
* This directive (Gen 3:22) will develop to: that to become a god a person must do a sin that is unforgivable within civilization to get "saved"... it keeps them silent.
* "friends (Job 2:11)"
* (narcisstic, desperate)
* it hides the flood
* the right: the enablers, the finger-waggers

## Things I Know About the Bible

* Jacob's taking of Esau's inheritance means: He took Esau's leadership as first-born away. The older brother has greater experience, a better perspective from the jungle that he has chopped away. By Jacob flooding (one-ing), joining heaven he becomes the authority. He continues to antagonize Esau and is rewarded for it. From this antagonizing he get god-isms, Jew support mechanisms (e.g. burning the barn...) which he can dole out to people to get them saved. Jacob creates Israel this way, a female-led nation, a contender to Judah. Jacob the father of a nation. Esau gets lost in the wilderness---for possibly the rest of his life (I am surmising that even Jacob's son Isaac may referring to Esau and being asked to sacrifice him). Left behind, a messiah. All saved people ignore him, laugh at him. He may die. I am the only person in history that may know this.
* Ruth is Bathsheba
* Jesus is a conglomeration of messiah stories. They are meant to demonstrate the new "right" policy. It is likely most based on Paul who was likely the one given up as a baby. This sacrifice got the Jews very excited.

## 25 and 28 Please Please Tell Me Pyrite from the Jews (Rather Than The Saved Taking More...)

The second system starts because it is a manifestation of biology. Takers hardly cared about givers. The first group probably numbered it because they always want to be in control of everything and the right seems to be okay with "bad at math". The second system usually defers priority, i.e. gives to the left first (12, 42...). Prioritizing seems to be tough for them: babies as sacrifices, looking pretty.... They already had their righteousness's like 52 and 82. But being outside of the control group, "bad at math".. they are left feeling, "How fair are we treated?" Still *wanting*. So when the Jews introduced 25 and 28 with the advent of the Christian Church[^25] (it is hopeful for me to think it was them that did this) the right soaked them up disregardless whether: if it was fair (same number of protections [87, 72...] the left has); or if they even knew what they meant (another pretty ring... for me?). Complicity.

* As the Catholic Church once required payment for absolution of sin... Today absolution of sin, for a saved person, can be define by the saved person themselves. Able to cull the heaven-verse and able to volunteer oneself and act as one sees fit. They get to eradicate their own guilt... even call it justice.

* The Book of the Scribe of Osiris (sometimes also referred to as the Book of the Journey to Aaru) is an Ancient Egyptian text discovered in the excavation of Oxyrhynchus. It has caused a certain degree of controversy among Egyptologists, as some argue that it is a classic funerary text such as the Book of Coming Forth by Day, while others believe it to be a poetic work not intended to be understood literally. \
  The book tells the story of a dying man who asks a scribe about the afterlife. The scribe, a servant of Osiris, describes how the man's Ka (life force) will become separated from his Ba (personality), and how he will have to reunite the two and become an Akh (living intellect), passing a series of trials in the Duat (underworld) in order to reach the paradise of Aaru. Unlike similar texts, the Book of the Scribe of Osiris focuses less on giving advice or /&# \
A recent study (Carnahan/Hassan) suggests the text may have been intended as philosophical commentary on the world of the living through the allegory of the Duat. It remains unclear whether this was the intent of the original pre-Alexandrian author or a result of the later translation into Greek. The earlier manuscript, which is considered to be more authentic, is too fragmentary to provide answers, though perhaps further excavation may %&$/§ \

[^definition-sin]: Simply defined as being against nature.
[^the-great-Jewish-two-system]: I am still working on this but I believe that now, this far in history with this system existant, that the Jews (at least by some) are investing in both sides. Since they know it exists and is obviously immanent they are going along with it. For example, the evidence of the recent Jew flopping's: Jerry Seinfeld "Unbounded", Richard Dreyfus "Hollywood out to get Jews", Kendrick losing to Drake.
[^definition-politics]: Politics can be defined as what absolutism/godisms has been gotten for a side (the right or the left) and what state they are in (the state has a lot to do with what **cycle/era** heaven is in). One that knows their politics (knows the predesigned system) basically knows what a side is allowed to do depending on the ebb and flow of power. Both sides force these borders near continually and try make new ones. Two god forces, male and female, taker and giver... I said before those that fight the war are the safe(r) ones.
[^Judeo-Christian-Definition]: I refrain from calling the Judeo-Christian system a religion because the common definition of religion usually involves spirituality with an ethereal god or gods.
[^definition-revisionistic]: From [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/revisionistic): [...] changing some accepted doctrine or view of history.

Interesting: the original flood story (skip to "Men in the mean time became wicked") or on Librivox [Part 5](https://librivox.org/history-of-egypt-chaldea-syria-babylonia-and-assyria-vol-3-by-gaston-maspero/).
[^definition-visceral]: I am using the definition from *Merriam Webster*: dealing with crude or elemental emotions, EARTHY; and from *The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, 5th Edition*. Being or arising from impulse or sudden emotion rather than from thought or deliberation.
[^definition-good]: The Bible defines this as the "knowledge of good and evil" (Genesis 2:9). Originally, it was only creating good, getting to choose what to support/favor (particularly people). I also like the term "divining". Evil came later when people started to declassify others to get inclusion.
[^pronoun-female]: Yes the Bible writers do constantly use the pronoun "he" throughout the Bible.
[^serpent]: Before the Bible the nine was the organizer of the nobility. He choose who the desperate men were and made sure they were rewarded. It builds to "the flood" later.
[^Story-of-the-Moral]: Using a Hebrew flood number/letter in the second term do get their angels somewhat excited... again deferential.

*To be a citizen is challenging duty---we have been intoxicated by a hierarchy that capitalizes fortune.*

# How the Judeo-Christian System Influences Civilization [^Information]

Civilization originally was as a natural order. This started to change when human beings reached the top of the food chain. Civilization started to be dominated by the male disposition because the checks on balance were disappearing. Some males became narcissistic. The ancestors of the Hebrews decided to underwrite them. They kept this knowledge silent from the narcissistic men (it got them better control). The narcissists became spoiled and immobile in their thinking. They infected people with their avarice and profit spread to a number of people. They created a dominion for a long age. After a time the citizens among them pleaded to keep the ethical code[^ethics]. The narcissists became antagonistic to the resistance the talk pervaded. The seer (the ancestor's administrator) wanted to assure their fortune and underwrote those who suppressed these citizens. He superimposed a leadership hierarchy on top of them.![alt text](images/05_civilization-superimposed.svg) ~~Citizens began losing their representation.~~ A female eventually countered. She felt indignant[^indignant] because females were losing representation (male physicality was increasingly rewarded). She knew she could get leadership by suppressing citizens better (largely mentally)[^smart]. She knew the narcissistic men and **repeated**[^repeated] many suppressions until she considered herself leader. The seer felt dismayed while she created an ethical code and warned people away from avarice. The seer, deific, "crafty", countered with a new rule: he was allowed to approach civilization's least fortunate citizens, tempt them with selfishness, and for doing so, offer them inclusion. The effect this had on civilization left the female dismayed. The overall effect of her counter segregated her associates from the commoners (casts away civilization): she (the female nines) and the fours will deter sympathy of the less fortunate to her associates; will abandon female leadership for near all; and promote "enmity" of the women to the seer (I hardly know if this is reciprocated, as claimed). By this horrible reaction she regained leadership partially (she was allow to direct representatives to try and control the people the seer corrupted). This counter created a long "golden" *age*[^switching] but chaffed too. The age revolves eventually back to the narcissistic men to become a cycle.

The giving infected many remaining females and their protected. All these sins were kept silent so it took some time before the narcissists learned of the female leader deception and recaptured[^betrayal] the narcissist's age again. Many inclusions of the least fortunate are revoked. 

The ages over the centuries grew more extreme, became more systemized, and got secreted by both sides. Today people that know of the system build safety by creating its politics[^politics]. It is extraordinarily split, mechanized, and deadly[^wars]. The Jews maintain it like a vital job. It is implemented it by rewarding narcissist policy (taking) for an age of fifty years (the political left[^left-right]) followed by allowing female policy (giving, restoring humanity) for an age of fifty years (the political right).![](images/10_cycles-of-heaven.svg) A third party also exists who kept from knowing of the system's existence. The Christian church (a succession of the political right) largely practices their beliefs with spiritual principles but is built upon a leadership (formed with the New Testament) that gets safety from the Jews by giving people from the third party as sacrifices. The system forces much of the social construct around the world. I have yet to find anyone who has a sufficient overview on what is happening.

* quarantines       * ~~(She disregarded that she had also profited from the age.)~~
* [^Judeo-Christian-Definition]: The typical definition of religion (to mean spiritual practice with an ethereal god) lacks being appropriate here. The Judeo-Christian process to those in the know is a system rather than a religion. Religion was used to disguise it because of many similiar properties.
* [^sinning]: Sinning is working against the law of nature. Sins are tools of the political right.

## Who I Am

I am a political prisoner of the Jews. I have been under this since I was born (1970) just like Jesus. The basic rule is only included people (those that know of the system) get treated fairly, get a share of society. I have been used as a tool by both political sides as a way to refine their policies (immortal rules, that selfish splitting). Some of us are large tools. The neuron-altering bugs vastly hamper my health, my ability, alter my knowledge, and change my feeling. My brain feels mixed up. People avoid me (a repulsion is sent out from my general area). It has been years since I have been able to talk to people. I have yet to have a friend in life. I wonder what realistic help is available. Are people ever going to realize the importance of prioritizing the less fortunate? I learned what I know now by living most of my life learning, questioning, and reviewing the Jewish hierarchal system as necessary to try and survive.

## Bible Translation

The research for this paper is from my personal experience, my limited reading of the history of Chaldea[^HECSBAV3], but mostly from the Bible. The Bible, the most read book in the world, is where the Jews and Christian leaders document their intent in their Testaments. The Old Testament has been refined many times by the Jews because their system is extraordinarily profitable. While the Bible has been created to thwart general understanding it is incredibly insightful if: one is willing to learn the ![](images/15_hebrew-code.svg)Hebrew Code[^Hebrew-Code], the missing history, overcome the graphic representations[^graphic], bypass the entire sections of rubbish, and forgive a very deliberate, clobbering of representatives (the Old Testament is generically mislabeled to secret its perpetuators). A couple more things: the beginning of the Bible is packed with details; ~~and the Bible was forced by the political right, their side of the story (except for Genesis 1), plus some of the third party they sometimes represent, the story of societal sliding and human sacrifices.~~

Warning: The details described herein contain vivid selfish acts that created fatal consequences. Please read with sympathy and consideration.

~~Civilization began as a natural order. This began to change when human beings reached the top of the food chain~~ **4100 years ago**. ~~Civilization began to be dominated by the male disposition because the checks on balance were disappearing. Some males became narcissistic~~: they focused on personal safety, hoarded all that they could, and allied to other fortunate people. ~~The ancestors of the Hebrews decided to underwrite them.~~ ~~They kept the narcissistic men ignorant of this knowledge to keep themselves safer.~~ ~~The narcissists became spoiled, infected a number of people with their avarice, grew immobile in their thinking, and seized dominions. The profit from the underwriting spread to a good number of people and lasted for a long age.~~ ~~The citizens feared the narcissistic men and yearned to keep the *herd*-like ways. The narcissistic men felt them directly in their path.~~ ~~The seer (the ancestor's administrator) dealt with this by underwriting leadership to those who suppressed acts of responsibility. Then he developed a power structure over these citizens.~~ ~~It smothered civilization.~~ ~~It created people who felt misrepresented because the catalyst of the male narcissistic age was their physical size. A prosperous female felt belligerent and learned that suppressions defined leadership. She knew the seer and decided to repeat[^repeated] his many suppressions. By his own rule, the seer lost leadership to the female. The female leader then declares an ethical code and warned people away from avarice[^smart]. ~~The seer feeling immutable, countered. Being "crafty" he made a new rule. He, the seer, was allowed to approach the most devastated citizens (where the ethical code helped the most), tempt them with selfishness, and offer inclusion (safety with the narcissistic men)[^friable] if they did so. Underwriting the most devastated citizens ravaged civilization from the bottom. The female leader, hardly to be outdone, regained leadership by fantasizing away civilization's values: there will be perpetual "enmity" between women and the seers, leadership forfeited for women, and the prosperous, female-friendly, people will have their higher status protected (Bible: prevented from them returning to their humbler origins [Gen 3:22]). This had the effect of creating another inclusion.

## Genesis 1

*Primary, Male-Led, Taking/Reaping* 

"In the beginning, God created the *heavens* and the *earth*

Heaven originally was an all-male institution. It lasted a long time and Genesis 1 covers it all---in one giant swath. To the Hebrews, men by *taking*, for themselves, create good; by defending create evil. A rewarded desperate-man took so much that the Hebrews refer to him as a "God", "In the beginning *God* created the **heavens** and the **earth**" (Gen 1:1 NIV). Much good and evil was created: heaven/earth, day/night, water/sky, land/sea, sun/moon, man/nature. This is a small example of backwritting[^backwrite] here (MENTION GOOD AND EVIL BELOW?).

## Genesis 2

*Secondary, Female-Led, Giving/Sowing* "By the **seventh** day God had finished the work... so on the **seventh** day he rested from all his work." (Gen 2:2). **It turns out both males and females can be narcissistic, created on the top of the food chain.** A new god is in town (LORD God female ♀) doubling, dividing a lot of what the male god did. Gods do a lot like their colleagues/brethren but being *gods* (being so smart) they have know one better facet of it. The female good too creates the world, the Garden of Eden, the trees (Good and Evil, Life). Is a bit hurt by the male-led audaciousness and makes the first rule: "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die (Gen 2:16-17)". Created Eve from man. Adam and Eve were still of nature though "naked and they felt no shame". Key word: **Eden** (2:8).

## Genesis 3

The Hebrew hierarchy is structured such: a bunch of narcissistic men ("nobles" in their days); nines (seer, serpent, Satan) are the administrators, organizers of the flood. As a single entity they originally went by "Ea" (which I believe later became "Hea" which is how Heaven got its name).

Eve takes the fruit because it is "good and pleasing to the eye" (Gen 3:6 repeats Gen 2:9), to "be like God", and because it is "desirable for gaining wisdom". She encourages Adam to "sin"/antagonize too and they become above nature's law, "realized they were naked".

## Genesis 4

Eve is the "LORD" here. Cain, Abel, and Seth are probably associates of Eve rather than her kin. I believe they are quarantining her. Cain and Abel try to bribe Eve with "fruits" and "fat-portions" so that they can get to heaven (fat-portions probably wins because it is something other than the fruit like of the tree of good and evil). "Do what is right (3:7)", "sin is crouching at your door", "you must rule over it". The line that "Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him" is a fooling, a trick. It says that those with Eve/LORD will emphasize the later definition (e.g. "brothers keeper")[^Story-of-the-Moral]. She too curses her male subjects (doubles the action... takes out the cursing) and still gets to "save" them *from Eden* (Gen 3:14-19). She also gives Cain protection, "... anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance **seven** times over".![](images/25_ages-of-civilization_seven.svg) Cain followed the directive where the god before put "cherubim and a flaming sword" and went around to the "east of Eden" (to the new heaven on the right). Lamech doubles the seven because he sees the trick, but something happened before:  Seer tempted E&A and gave temporary heavenly protection, LG made a new heaven for them.

## Notes

* *Personal Salvation*... "get **saved**".
* Because the Jews are *safely* above it all... they get to decide who gets included.
* The first group's success becomes so **addictive** that they eventually begin cannibalizing on civilization---going after the poor. The golden age: eat, drink, and be merry, then sacrificing the poor for protection.
* Be wary of the female god---an addiction it is to her too. Females like being on top just as much. Taking feels like success.
* "eternal life"
* Their definition of it *is literally heaven*.
* Heaven became too obvious.

[^indignant]: The Hebrews call this belligerent.
[^ethics]: The underwriting spread selfish behavior among the people. When it becomes disregarding, it became sin (living outside of nature's law).
[^repeated]: The system developed to repeating someone else's suppression (against an Equal) and changing one facet of it (deconstruct herd mentality). The repetition helps disguise the original act. Today they have developed to have the appearance of being meritorious/ethical (e.g. "working out"...).
[^friable]: This safety only lasts as long as the seer sees need for it (generally only as long as the female has leadership).
[^smart]: She forced her own inclusion and other females mentally (being a part of the upper/safer class) the Bible says made her feel smart. It had the consequence of bypassing the process of justice/law-for-all-people (accumulating evidence, discussion, and a trial by peers) and is still enacted today . She choose the path technically because a feeling of outwitting nature---it was a safer path.
[^betrayal]: To the narcissists there is only the taking---it is addicting. Civilization recovered some but learned some of what was done to them. They were hurt by the narcissists age so they altered their sacred system ("betrayed" likely what the narcissists said). || This started a long history of finger pointing. After a number of revolutions the seer having been forced to "... roam[] throughout the earth, going back and forth on it" intimidates the female god to give a sacrifice. [^debt]: The Jews sometimes give things (someone may even accidentally acquire a thing) and they will call it a debt even if the recipient lacks being told about it.
[^switching]: The switching of policy has the effect of relieving its beneficiaries of long-term one-sided policy issues. But each policy lasts so long they create competition rather than cooperation.
[^politics]: Politics comes from the Jews. It is based on policy. There are two policies: male and female (taking and giving). They both last fifty years. Politics is following, enforcing, or adding to the policy of the age. Some policies are pretty consistent: pink (right), blood!?(left). Some are shared: Hasbro, Disney, Lego. Some make little sense: the right as gambling and racing; the left has government subsidized cell phones for the poor and government subsidized solar power installations. Most policy is on course: sugar and spice; puppy-dogs... These male/female values are only valuable among the mainstream: the poor care little of pink, the female Jews like the hits on Monday Night Football. Even deeper, the catalyst is the messiah, the exemption. Whatever misfortune happens to that person, whatever need that person requests of a saved person and to be directly worked against, becomes the new rule.
[^wars]: The political right ignorant of some inclusion and hurt by the reckless reaping of the left can declare literal wars with their political counterparts.
[^left-right]: Though the definition of political left and right has been around nearly as long as this system (religion) has, it is better defined today as political top and bottom. I'll get more into this later.
[^Hebrew-Code]: The Hebrew people (and many others today) use a code to share secrets with. It is hidden within ordinary language. The base meanings have *absolute* definitions.
[^HECSBAV3]: [History of Egypt, Chaldea, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Vol. 3](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/17323/17323-h/17323-h.htm). Interesting: the original flood story (skip to "Men in the mean time became wicked") or on Librivox [Part 5](https://librivox.org/history-of-egypt-chaldea-syria-babylonia-and-assyria-vol-3-by-gaston-maspero/).
[^graphic]: Its graphicness can hide meanings that can only be tolerated by those who have abundant health (from supernatural safety).
[^backwrite]: my word... making newer rules apply throughout. Possibly I could make revisionistic work. From [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/revisionistic): changing some accepted doctrine or view of history.

## The Story of the Moral

Political Right Faults:
1) Sacrifices.
2) Deferring authority---especially during important situations.
3) Overview forsaking, accepting protection from obscure knowledge, act like they know what they are talking about, vanity, "Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.". The political right's knowledge is sparse and often incorrect. One example is using the Hebrew Code in a way that discriminates against the third party. If the perpetuator uses the Hebrew Code in a way that is discriminating, the Jews will reward inclusion (requires audacity usually).
4) Keeping the system silent, "Revenge is a good life". The leaders keep heaven from becoming too obvious.
5) Spiritualism (substituting visceral-ness).
6) Failing to deal with the Jews re-labeling their history.

Unless we all go through it together the excitement that the Jews feel will continue... a feeling of free, an addiction.

* Safety is coveted in nature. To even be able to depend on it a little is an *addiction*. Having it leads to conservatism, a dispersal of toleration (one fails to see how their safety effects the less fortunate) then bias (beginning to avoid certain people). Safety corrupts civilization.

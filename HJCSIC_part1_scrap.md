*Civilization is putting the needs of those that need it first, but to be a citizen is monumental task---we battle a hierarchy that has left humanity obsessed with free/pleasurably powered.*

# How the Judeo-Christian System Influences Civilization [^Information]

Civilization began as a natural order. 4100 years ago this began to change when human beings reached the top of the food chain. Because the checks on balance were disappearing civilization began to be dominated by the male disposition. Some males became narcissistic: they focused on personal safety, hoarded all that they could, and allied to other fortunate people. The Jewish ancestors decided to underwrite them (absent of the narcissists knowing about it---it kept them safer). The narcissists got spoiled, became immobile in their thinking, infected a number of men (and their spouses) with their audaciousness, and sometimes seized empires. They were people to be feared. This happened for a long age and the underwriter's profit was large. The narcissist's age had a devastating effect on civilization. The seer (the ancestor's representative) was put under pressure (by some people who knew what was going on) to stop support of the narcissistic men. Being clever, the seer, redirected the underwriting from the husbands to the wives who were to support the *females* who were selfish. This was to hide the profit the male narcissist policy got them[^evolved]. The selfish females rewarded people who countered the male narcissist's policy; it infected many remaining females, and those they chose to protect. It created a "golden age" after which it revolved to another narcissist's age (male policy) to begin a cycle[^switching]. The ages over the centuries grew more extreme, became more systemized, and got secreted by the Jewish ancestors. Today people that know of the system seek protection by knowing its politics[^politics]. It is extraordinarily split, mechanized, and deadly[^wars]. The Jews maintain it like a vital job. They implement it by rewarding male policy (taking) for an age of fifty years (the political left[^left-right]) followed by rewarding female policy (giving) for an age of fifty years (the political right). There is also a third party who are kept from knowing the system's existence. The Christian church (a succession of the political right) largely practices their beliefs with spiritual principles but is built upon a leadership (formed with the New Testament) that gets safety from the Jews by giving them people from the third party as sacrifices. The system forces much of the social construct around the world .I have yet to find anyone who has a sufficient overview on what is happening.

## I May Be Listened to Because...

I am a political prisoner of the Jews. I have been here since I was born (just like Jesus) in 1970. The basic rule is only included people (those that know of the system) get treated fairly, get a share of the rewards, "get "eternal life". I have been used as a tool by both political sides as a way to refine their policies (immortal rules, that selfish splitting). Some of us are large tools. The neuron-altering bugs vastly hamper my health, my ability, alter my knowledge, and change my feeling. My brain feels mixed up. People avoid me (a repulsion is sent out from my general area). It has been years since I have been able to talk to people. I have yet to have a friend in live. I wonder what realistic help is available. Do people feel the pull of selfishness? I learned what I know now by living most of my life learning, questioning, and reviewing the Jewish hierarchal system.

## My Research Sources are...

The research for this paper is from my experiences but mostly from the Bible. The Bible, the most read book in the world, is where the Jews and Christian leaders document their intent---institutions that have been around awhile usually provide a plan. The Bible does make sense if one learns the missing history, overcomes the graphic representations[^graphic], entire sections of rubbish, and a very deliberate, damaging, re-writing of history.

The Bible is back-written(revisionistic?[^revisionistic]) so newer rules apply throughout.

## The Story of the Moral

Political Right Faults:
1) Sacrifices.
2) Deferring authority---even during important situations.
3) Accepting protection from obscure knowledge, vanity, "Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.". The political right's knowledge is sparse and often incorrect. One example is using the Hebrew Code in a way that discriminates against the third party. Even if a person lacks knowing the Hebrew Code's official meanings they will be rewarded by the Jews (usually with some selfishness added).
4) Keeping the system silent, "Revenge is a good life". The leaders keep heaven from becoming too obvious.
5) Spiritualism
6) Leaders failing to deal with the Jews re-writing of history?

Unless we all go through it together the excitement that the Jews feel will continue... a feeling of free, an addiction.

[^evolved]: It evolved to making civilization think that they restored humanity.
[^switching]: The switching of policy has the effect of relieving its beneficiaries of long-term one-sided policy issues. But each policy lasts so long it is hard to create a balance between the two.
[^wars]: The political right ignorant of some inclusion and hurt by the reckless reaping of the left can declare literal wars with their political counterparts.
[^politics]: Politics comes from the Jews. It is based on policy. There are two policies: male and female. They both last fifty years. Politics is following, enforcing, or adding to the policy of the age/era. Some policies are pretty consistent: pink (right), blood!?(left). Some are shared: Hasbro, Disney, Legos. Some make little sense: the right as gambling and racing; the left has government subsidized cell phones for the poor and government subsidized solar power installations. Most policy is on course: sugar and spice; puppy-dogs... These male/female, usually land of the living values, become less valid with safety (the higher up the hierarchy). Female Jews like the hits on Monday Night Football too. Even deeper, the catalyst is the messiah, the exemption. Whatever misfortune happens to that person, whatever need that person requests of a saved person and to be directly worked against, becomes the new rule.
[^left-right]: Though the definition of political left and right has been around nearly as long as this system (religion) has, it is better defined today as political top and bottom. I'll get more into this later.
[^graphic]: Its graphicness can hide meanings that can only be tolerated by those who have abundant health (from supernatural safety).
[^revisionistic]: From [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/revisionistic): [...] changing some accepted doctrine or view of history.

* Describe how the Promoted Mortals (Adam and Eve) reacted. They gave Eden-ites, Adam and Eve, a temporary rule (made them representatives) and allowed them to think they fixed it. It was a temporary safety though, a faux heaven, a temporary free.
* *Personal Salvation*... those that know the detail get the rewards, "get saved".
* Mention: Gods immortal/mortal, the "human condition"?
* Because the Jews are *safely* above it all... they get to decide who gets included.
* Safety is coveted in nature. To even be able to depend on it a little is an *addiction*. Having it leads to conservatism (one fails to see how their safety effects the less fortunate) then bias (beginning to avoid certain people). Safety leads to corruption.
* The first group's success becomes so **addictive** that they eventually begin cannibalizing on civilization---going after the poor, then creating traps to make people poor; the golden age: eat, drink, and be merry, then sacrificing the poor for protection.
* Their definition of it was literally *heaven*.
* Be wary of the female god---an addiction it is to her too. Females like being on top just as much. Taking feels like success.
~~* The female god was created by the serpent.~~

How was the Serpent crafty?
[+] Heaven became too obvious. The serpent changed the rewards to females to hide things.
[-] Started a selfish war between mortals---lacks being the intent.

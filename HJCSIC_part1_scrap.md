* *Civilization is putting the needs of those that need it first, but to be a citizen is fantastical---we battle a hierarchy that offers free.*

Civilization began as a natural order. 4100 years ago this began to change when human beings reached the top of the food chain. Because the checks on balance were disappearing civilization began to be overlaid with rampant testosterone. The male disposition dominated, the fortunate allied to other fortunates, empires were seized. It was liked so much it got systemized and secreted by the Jewish ancestors. In time the female disposition became so repressed that they retaliated in force and made an age of their own. Today it has been reduced to a dual male-female system of selfish snatching that is extraordinarily split, mechanized, and deadly---it forces the social construct of the world. It is implemented by rewarding reaping acts (taking, usually men) for an era of fifty years... followed by rewarding sowing acts (giving, usually women) for an era of fifty years. The Jews allowed the sowing group as inevitable and to deal with the resistance.

* What this has led to today is a system extraordinarily systemized where their males rule for fifty years followed by a female rule of fifty years.
* The Jewish-led first group become so anchored in their thinking...
* The right keeps heaven from becoming too obvious.
* personal salvation... those that know the details...
* Some call this the "human condition".
* Today, it is a large entity in forcing the social construct of the world. 
* The Hebrews created the right (from the beginning) as an alternate inclusion. SPECULATION... prob. true
* Doubling like all their ancestors before them...
* Safety leads to conservatism then bias.
* Do the Jews double a giver, double their givers... a lazy way of paying attention to nature... thereby guaranteeing their survival?
* When the fortunate reward the fortunate all rewards flow to the top. Eventually the fortunate cannibalize civilization, profit from the poor suffering.

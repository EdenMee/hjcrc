* *Civilization is putting the needs of those that need it first, but to be a citizen is fantastical---our leadership has succumbed largely to personal salvation.*

Civilization began as a natural order. 4100 years ago this began to change when human beings reached the top of the food chain. Because the checks on balance were disappearing civilization began to be overlaid with rampant testosterone. The male disposition dominated, empires formed, and the fortunate allied to other fortunates. It was liked so much it got systemized and secreted by the Jewish ancestors. Eventually a repressed female disposition built-up and ~~repelled~~ forced an age of their own. What it has led to today is a system extraordinarily split and mechanized.

* Today, the Jews implement it by rewarding *reaping* acts for an era of fifty years (i.e. taking---usually men).
* Whet this has led to today is a system extraordinarily systemized where their males rule for fifty years followed by a female rule of fifty years.

* Some call this the "human condition".
* Today, it is a large entity in forcing the social construct of the world. 

**Doubling like all their ancestors before them**

Civilization moved from evolution of a community to salvation of an individual through joining a secret, predesigned/mechanized system (those that learn the details/behavior? of the system get the rewards). The system started thousands of years ago with male dominion (dynasties---fortunate people rewarding other fortunate people) and got secreted by the Jews. Today, the Jews implement it by rewarding *reaping* acts for an era of fifty years (i.e. taking---usually men). In this era **selfishness** becomes so proliferate, the reapers, the Jews, the first group, the political left, become so profited, so anchored in their thinking, that they draw the hostility of a second group of people. For the following fifty years the Jews tolerate/reward[^the-great-Jewish-two-system] *sowing* acts (making things grow/giving) *to deal with the resistance* (it affects women, their protected, men of lesser fortune---the political right). The entire system is kept silent through all of time. By the silence, alternating support, and by intent much confusion is caused to people outside the first group. This can get people in the second group to occasionally call an all-out *war* against the Jews. Being so stimulated/excited the Jews are little deterred by the second group's frustration and the second group eventually succumbs-to/**duplicates** the behavior to get recognition. This behavior has made the second group associated/complicit with the left. It is demonstrated in these ways: the right accepts answers from the Jews in how they use the Hebrew Code, these answers are rewarded because they *discriminate/are-libel* against the *third group* (the people with little knowledge of the first group or who are intentionally left behind)---the second group's knowledge is usually sparse and often incorrect; the right often defers authority despite importance (by numbers [12,42] and otherwise); the right in their anger loses focus with people that need help the most (the third group); and the right keeps the system largely silent. The Christian church (a succession of the second group) largely practices their beliefs with spiritual principles but is built upon a leadership (female?), formed with the New Testament, that establishes the largest complicity with the Jews by giving people as sacrifices to get safety from them. The Jew maintain the system like a vital job. From it they get: physical protection (in the first fifty years), trust from the third group who they are given much free attention to, and through it all authority and wealth. Their definition of it is literally *heaven*. I have yet to find anyone who has any sufficient overview of what is happening---**the effect on the world is tremendous**. This system forces much of the social construct of the world.

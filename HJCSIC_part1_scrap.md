Civilization began as a natural order. 4100 years ago this began to change when human beings reached the top of the food chain. Because the checks on balance were disappearing civilization began to be overlaid with rampant testosterone. The male disposition dominated, the fortunate allied to other fortunate people, empires were seized. It was liked so much it got systemized and secreted by the Jewish ancestors. In time the female disposition became so repressed that they retaliated viciously and got a similar age. Today it can be summarized as a dual male-female system of selfish snatching that is extraordinarily split, mechanized, and deadly that forces the social construct of the world. It is implemented by rewarding reaping acts (taking, usually men) for an era of fifty years... followed by rewarding sowing acts (giving, usually women) for an era of fifty years.
* The entire system is kept silent through all of time. By the silence, alternating support, and sometimes intent much confusion is caused to the people outside the reaper group (the political left).

* The Jewish-led first group become so anchored in their thinking...
* The right keeps heaven from becoming too obvious.
* *Personal Salvation*... those that know the details...
* Some call this the "human condition".
* The Hebrews created the right (from the beginning??!) as an alternate inclusion. SPECULATION... prob. true... create the female god too???
* Doubling (better known as halving?) like all their ancestors before them... Do the Jews double a giver, double their givers... a lazy way of paying attention to nature... thereby guaranteeing their survival?
* Safety leads to conservatism then bias.
* When the fortunate reward the fortunate all rewards flow to the top. Eventually the fortunate cannibalize civilization... profit from the poor suffering.
* The Jews allowed the sowing group as inevitable and to deal with the resistance.
* MENTION?: Christians!, Gods?
* "Call an all out war"?

**Genesis 5** *(Some Rule Eden, Generally Female Policy)*: A time span of ten male rulers from Adam to Noah is defined. ~~The "E" is kept so silent that the reapers accept ENOSH as leader?!~~ When the females get their era back they put a reaper god there to rule... within female policy. Two more eras happen (Mahalalel and Jared) then Enoch rules in another male era (even more Edenish) and the reapers figure it out, "God took him [Enoch] away (Gen 5:25)." An Eden ruler Methuselah  rules the female era, then the reapers put in a female-appointed god (Lamech). Then Noah comes, the avenging angel. Lamech proclaims that Noah is to restore god rule that Adam's weak, female appointed rule, lost, "[Noah] will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the LORD has cursed (references Gen 3:17)."

**Genesis 6** *(She Said but a dual-power to restore heaven)*: Attack on Eden begins. God pronounces a dual-power, "a hundred and twenty years." The "sons of God" (female leaders) sucked up the pride in their own god-ness and mated with the "daughters of humans" (desperate men, angels). This created Nephilim---people that are physical giants, knowing little borders, people to be feared---to create heaven again. The Lord (a female god here) is upset because civilization is co-operative and thoughtful ("wickedness... [and] evil" Gen 6:5) and wants to restore the gods to power. She uses Eden's name (3,5,6) to set-up the exercising of god power, "The ark is to be *three* hundred cubits long, *fifty* cubits wide and *thirty* cubits high. (Gen 6:15).

**Genesis 7** *(He Said, Business, Partisanship)*: (`The flood is rewarding, in synchronicity, a large number of *desperate* men to create "heaven on earth", partisanship, creating good and evil. [^flood]`.) The Lord found Noah "righteous" (godly) and he flooded the *earth*, put a*n*imals on the Ark, to restore the gods to power. More using Eden's name for god power, "Noah was six hundred years old...", etc.. (`"The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days (Gen 6:24)" is used in modern times to denote yearly floods from to January 1 to May 31 (absent a leap year)`).

## Things I Know About the Bible

* Jacob's taking of Esau's inheritance means: He took Esau's leadership as first-born away. The older brother has greater experience, a better perspective from the jungle that he has chopped away. By Jacob flooding (one-ing), joining heaven he becomes the authority. He continues to antagonize Esau and is rewarded for it. From this antagonizing he get god-isms, Jew support mechanisms (e.g. burning the barn...) which he can dole out to people to get them saved. Jacob creates Israel this way, a female-led nation, a contender to Judah. Jacob the father of a nation. Esau gets lost in the wilderness---for possibly the rest of his life (I am surmising that even Jacob's son Isaac may referring to Esau and being asked to sacrifice him). Left behind, a messiah. All saved people ignore him, laugh at him. He may die. I am the only person in history that may know this.
* Ruth is Bathsheba
* Jesus is a conglomeration of messiah stories. They are meant to demonstrate the new "right" policy. It is likely most based on Paul who was likely the one given up as a baby. This sacrifice got the Jews very excited.

## 25 and 28 Please Please Tell Me Pyrite from the Jews (Rather Than The Saved Taking More...)

The second system started smaller physicality. The second system usually defers priority, i.e. gives to the left first (12, 42...). Prioritizing seems to be tough for them: babies as sacrifices, looking pretty.... They already had their selfish split: like 52 and 82. But being outside of the control group, "bad at math".. they are left feeling, "How fair are we treated?" Still *wanting*. So they invented 25 and 28 with the advent of the Christian Church[^25] the right created them up disregardless whether: if it was fair (same number of protections [87, 72...] the left has); or if they discriminated (another pretty ring... for me?). Guilty.

* As the Catholic Church once required payment for absolution of sin... Today absolution of sin, for a saved person, can be define by the saved person themselves. Able to cull the heaven-verse and able to volunteer oneself and act as one sees fit. They get to eradicate their own guilt... even call it justice.

* The Book of the Scribe of Osiris (sometimes also referred to as the Book of the Journey to Aaru) is an Ancient Egyptian text discovered in the excavation of Oxyrhynchus. It has caused a certain degree of controversy among Egyptologists, as some argue that it is a classic funerary text such as the Book of Coming Forth by Day, while others believe it to be a poetic work not intended to be understood literally. The book tells the story of a dying man who asks a *scribe* about the afterlife. The scribe, a servant of Osiris, describes how the man's Ka (life force) will become separated from his Ba (personality), and how he will have to reunite the two and become an Akh (living intellect), passing a series of trials in the Duat (underworld) in order to reach the paradise of Aaru. Unlike similar texts, the Book of the Scribe of Osiris focuses less on giving advice or /&# \ A recent study (Carnahan/Hassan) suggests the text may have been intended as philosophical commentary on the world of the living through the allegory of the Duat. It remains unclear whether this was the intent of the original pre-Alexandrian author or a result of the later translation into Greek. The earlier manuscript, which is considered to be more authentic, is too fragmentary to provide answers, though perhaps further excavation may %&$/§ \

[^the-great-Jewish-two-system]: I am still working on this but I believe that now, this far in history with this system existent, that the seers are investing in both sides. Since they know it exists and is obviously immanent they are going along with it. For example, the evidence of the recent Jew flopping's: Jerry Seinfeld "Unbounded", Richard Dreyfus "Hollywood out to get Jews", Kendrick losing to Drake.
[^definition-visceral]: I am using the definition from *Merriam Webster*: dealing with crude or elemental emotions, EARTHY; and from *The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, 5th Edition*. Being or arising from impulse or sudden emotion rather than from thought or deliberation.
[^pronoun-female]: Yes the Bible writers do constantly use the pronoun "he" throughout the Bible.
[^serpent]: Before the Bible the nine was the organizer of the nobility. He choose who the desperate men were and made sure they were rewarded. It builds to "the flood" later.
[^Story-of-the-Moral]: Using a Hebrew flood number/letter in the second term do get their angels somewhat excited... again deferential.
<!-- [^flood]:  -->
[^25]: December 25 and the year of Jesus's death.

* Double and get higher.
* "friends (Job 2:11)"
* plausible deniability
* There is only one system.

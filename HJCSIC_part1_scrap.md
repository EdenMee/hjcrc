*Civilization is putting the needs of those that need it first, but to be a citizen is fantastical task---we battle a hierarchy that offers free.*

# How the Judeo-Christian System Influences Civilization [^Information]

![](images/05_ages-of-civilization_eden.svg)![](images/10_cycles-of-heaven.svg)Civilization began as a natural order. 4100 years ago this began to change when human beings reached the top of the food chain. Because the checks on balance were disappearing civilization began to be dominated by the male disposition. They followed fortune, allied to others doing well, and empires were seized. They became so excited they were **hard to sway**. Eventually the profitable male domination behavior risked being criticized (became too obvious) and some females (their wives, etc.) wanted to hide how they got their fortune.
* Cannibalism
* It was so profitable it got systemized and secreted by the Jewish ancestors.
* ~~Some time later the female disposition became so repressed that they retaliated viscerally and got a similar age.~~
Today it can be summarized as a dual male-female system of selfish snatching that is extraordinarily split, mechanized, and deadly. It underlies the social construct of the world. They implement it by rewarding reaping (taking) acts for an era of fifty years (the first group, male-led and their followers, the political left) followed by rewarding sowing acts (giving) for an era of fifty years (the second group, female-led and their followers, the political right). The entire system is **secreted** through all of time. By the secrets, alternating support, and sometimes intent much confusion is caused to the people with less knowledge of it (lower in the hierarchy).

* The right keeps heaven from becoming too obvious.
* *Personal Salvation*... those that know the details...
* Some call this the "human condition".
* The Hebrews created the right (from the beginning??!) as an alternate inclusion. SPECULATION... prob. true... create the female god too???
* Doubling (better known as halving?) like all their ancestors before them... Do the Jews double a giver, double their givers... a lazy way of paying attention to nature... thereby guaranteeing their survival? Follow those that help... cannibalism. 
* Safety leads to conservatism then bias.
* When the fortunate reward the fortunate all rewards flow to the top. Eventually the fortunate cannibalize civilization... profit from the poor suffering.
* The Jews create the sowing group, accept it as inevitable, to deal with the resistance.
* MENTION?: Christians!, Gods?
* "Call an all out war"?
* Because the Jews have always controlled the path to inclusion they have got to make the rules.
* Be wary of all higher in the hierarchy. The higher, male or female, what takers they both are.

Right Guilts:
1) Deferring Authority
2) Secreting or keeping it silent
3) "Revenge is a good life"

*Civilization is putting the needs of those that require them first but to be a citizen is monumental task, we have been corrupted by a hierarchy that capitalizes on fortune.*

# How the Judeo-Christian System Influences Civilization [^Information]

![](images/05_ages-of-civilization_eden.svg)![](images/10_cycles-of-heaven.svg)Civilization began as a natural order. This began to change when human beings reached the top of the food chain 4100 years ago. Civilization began to be dominated by the male disposition because the checks on balance were disappearing. Some males became narcissistic: they focused on personal safety, hoarded all that they could, and allied to other fortunate people. The ancestors of the Hebrews decided to underwrite them; the narcissists were kept ignorant of this knowledge to keep the ancestors safer. The narcissists became spoiled, grew immobile in their thinking, infected a number of people with their avarice, and seized dominions. ~~The narcissists were people citizens feared.~~ The underwriting lasted for a long age and the profit spread to a good number of people. Some citizens yearned to keep the **herd**-like ways. The narcissistic men felt them directly in their path. They developed a power structure, a system, to repress/suppress/antagonize them.![alt text](images/13_power-structure.svg) It had a devastating effect on civilization. The seer (the ancestor's administrator) began rewarding additional leadership for repressive acts. Some citizens who had to talk about serious problems became severely repressed. A repression occurred where a female (a wife, a sister) decides to bypass the process of justice (accumulating evidence, discussion, and a trial by peers) and accrue leadership through the narcissistic men's power system because it was the safer path. She began repeating repressions[^repeating] until she got leadership. She then pushed an ethical code and warned people way from avarice.


The seer obliged to follow the rules of leadership end-rounded the female ruler by being "crafty".He approached the most devastated people in civilization and offered them inclusion for acts of selfishness. *Civilization began to become **unraveled** from the bottom.* The female leader remonstrates/plays-rebuffed, protects herself, blames civilization for getting her involved, and (again, how nice) casts away civilization's values (even for the future) there will be: perpetual "enmity" (only competition) between the woman and the seer ("serpent"), leadership forfeiture for women, and for those well-to-do outside the system prevention from them returning to their humbler origins. 

These actions eventually develop superficial altruism (giving, restoring humanity) for the protection it gave them. These actions developed (superficial?) to altruism (giving, restoring humanity) because they needed protection from the less fortunate. The giving infected many remaining females and their protected.  It was called a "golden" age. All these sins were kept respectably silent so it took some time until the narcissists learned of the female leader deception and recaptured[^betrayal] the narcissist's age again---it began a cycle[^switching]. The female leaders in the capitalistic age profit until they learn of their guilt again. Many inclusions of the least fortunate are revoked. The ages over the centuries grew more extreme, became more systemized, and got secreted by both sides (the right takes the pain out). Today people that know of the system build safety by creating its politics[^politics]. It is extraordinarily split, mechanized, and deadly[^wars]. The Jews maintain it like a vital job. They implement it by rewarding narcissist policy (taking) for an age of fifty years (the political left[^left-right]) followed by allowing female policy (giving) for an age of fifty years (the political right). A third party also exists who kept exempt from knowing of the system's existence. The Christian church (a succession of the political right) largely practices their beliefs with spiritual principles but is built upon a leadership (formed with the New Testament) that gets safety from the Jews by giving people from the third party as sacrifices. The system forces much of the social construct around the world. I have yet to find anyone who has a sufficient overview on what is happening.

## Who I Am

I am a political prisoner of the Jews. I have been here since I was born (just like Jesus) in 1970. The basic rule is only included people (those that know of the system) get treated fairly, get a share of society. I have been used as a tool by both political sides as a way to refine their policies (immortal rules, that selfish splitting). Some of us are large tools. The neuron-altering bugs vastly hamper my health, my ability, alter my knowledge, and change my feeling. My brain feels mixed up. People avoid me (a repulsion is sent out from my general area). It has been years since I have been able to talk to people. I have yet to have a friend in life. I wonder what realistic help is available. Are people ever going to realize the importance of prioritizing the less fortunate? I learned what I know now by living most of my life learning, questioning, and reviewing the Jewish hierarchal system as necessary to try and survive.

## Research Sources

The research for this paper is from the Bible but also from my personal experiences and limited reading of the history of Chaldea[^HECSBAV3]. The Bible, the most read book in the world, is where the Jews and Christian leaders document their intent. Institutions that have been around awhile usually provide a plan---both the Jews and the Christians have described their plans in their Testaments. The Old Testament has been refined many times by the Jews because their system is extraordinarily profitable. Though the Testaments fail to be fair declarations with civilization, the Bible does provide insight on what this system is doing to civilization if one is willing to learn the ![](images/15_hebrew-code.svg)Hebrew Code[^Hebrew-Code], the missing history, overcome the graphic representations[^graphic], bypass the entire sections of rubbish, and forgive a very deliberate, clobbering of history (the Old Testament is generically mislabeled to secret its system). A couple more things: the beginning of the Bible is packed with details; and the Bible was forced by the political right, their side of the story (except for Genesis 1), plus some of the third party they sometimes represent, the story of societal sliding and human sacrifices.

Warning: The details described herein contain vivid selfish acts that created horrid consequences. Please read with sympathy and consideration.

## Bible Translation---Genesis 1

*Primary, Male-Led, Taking/Reaping* Heaven originally was an all-male institution. It lasted a long time and Genesis 1 covers it all---in one giant swath. To the Hebrews, men by *taking*, for themselves, create good. A rewarded desperate-man took so much that the Hebrews refer to him as a "God", "In the beginning *God* created the **heavens** and the **earth**" (Gen 1:1 NIV). Originally only good was created: heaven, day, water... (rather than: heaven/earth, day/night, water/sky, land/sea, sun/moon, man/nature). This is a small example of backwritting[^backwrite] here (MENTION GOOD AND EVIL BELOW?).

## Genesis 2

*Secondary, Female-Led, Giving/Sowing* "By the **seventh** day God had finished the work... so on the **seventh** day he rested from all his work." (Gen 2:2). **It turns out both males and females can be narcissistic, created on the top of the food chain.** A new good is in town (LORD God female â™€) doubling, dividing a lot of what the male god did. Gods do a lot like their colleagues/brethren but being *gods*(being so smart, I suppose) they have know one better facet of it. The female good too creates the world, the Garden of Eden, the trees (Good and Evil, Life). Is a bit hurt by the male-led audaciousness and makes the first rule: "You are free to eat from any tree in the garden; but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat from it you will certainly die (Gen 2:16-17)". Created Eve from man. Adam and Eve were still of nature though "naked and they felt no shame". Key word: **Eden** (2:8).

## Genesis 3

The Hebrew hierarchy is structured such: a bunch of narcissistic men ("nobles" in their days); nines (seer, serpent, Satan) are the administrators, organizers of the flood. As a single entity they originally went by "Ea" (which I believe later became "Hea" which is how Heaven got its name).

Eve takes the fruit because it is "good and pleasing to the eye" (Gen 3:6 repeats Gen 2:9), to "be like God", and because it is "desirable for gaining wisdom". She encourages Adam to "sin"/antagonize too and they become above nature's law, "realized they were naked".

## Notes

* *Personal Salvation*... "get **saved**".
* Because the Jews are *safely* above it all... they get to decide who gets included.
* Safety is coveted in nature. To even be able to depend on it a little is an *addiction*. Having it leads to conservatism, a dispersal of toleration (one fails to see how their safety effects the less fortunate) then bias (beginning to avoid certain people). Safety corrupts civilization.
* The first group's success becomes so **addictive** that they eventually begin cannibalizing on civilization---going after the poor. The golden age: eat, drink, and be merry, then sacrificing the poor for protection.
* Be wary of the female god---an addiction it is to her too. Females like being on top just as much. Taking feels like success.
* "eternal life"
* Their definition of it *is literally heaven*.
* Heaven became too obvious.
* Some people who profited from the age but learned of the ancestor's underwriting began to feel guilty.[^wives]. Eventually they collaborated and put pressure on the seer (the ancestor's administrator) to stop supporting the narcissists.

[^repeating]: The system developed to repeating someone else's repression (against an Equal) and changing one facet of it (double, divide, and deconstruct herd mentatlity). The repetition helps disguise the original act. Today they have developed to have the appearance of being meritorious/ethical (e.g. "working out"...).
[^betrayal]: To the narcissists there is only the taking---it is addicting. ~~To stop it, the seer had to promise equal representation to the defiers.~~ Civilization began to recover but learned some of what was done to them. They were hurt by the narcissists age so they altered their sacred system ("betrayed" likely what the narcissists said). || This started a long history of finger pointing. After a number of revolutions the seer having been forced to "... roam[] throughout the earth, going back and forth on it" intimidates the female god to give a sacrifice. [^debt]: The Jews sometimes give things (someone may even accidentally acquire a thing) and they will call it a debt even if the recipient lacks being told about it.
[^switching]: The switching of policy has the effect of relieving its beneficiaries of long-term one-sided policy issues. But each policy lasts so long they create competition rather than cooperation.
[^politics]: Politics comes from the Jews. It is based on policy. There are two policies: male and female (taking and giving). They both last fifty years. Politics is following, enforcing, or adding to the policy of the age. Some policies are pretty consistent: pink (right), blood!?(left). Some are shared: Hasbro, Disney, Lego. Some make little sense: the right as gambling and racing; the left has government subsidized cell phones for the poor and government subsidized solar power installations. Most policy is on course: sugar and spice; puppy-dogs... These male/female values are only valuable among the mainstream: the poor care little of pink, the female Jews like the hits on Monday Night Football. Even deeper, the catalyst is the messiah, the exemption. Whatever misfortune happens to that person, whatever need that person requests of a saved person and to be directly worked against, becomes the new rule.
[^wars]: The political right ignorant of some inclusion and hurt by the reckless reaping of the left can declare literal wars with their political counterparts.
[^left-right]: Though the definition of political left and right has been around nearly as long as this system (religion) has, it is better defined today as political top and bottom. I'll get more into this later.
[^Hebrew-Code]: The Hebrew people (and many others today) use a code to share secrets with. It is hidden within ordinary language. The base meanings have *absolute* definitions.
[^HECSBAV3]: [History of Egypt, Chaldea, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Vol. 3](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/17323/17323-h/17323-h.htm). Interesting: the original flood story (skip to "Men in the mean time became wicked") or on Librivox [Part 5](https://librivox.org/history-of-egypt-chaldea-syria-babylonia-and-assyria-vol-3-by-gaston-maspero/).
[^graphic]: Its graphicness can hide meanings that can only be tolerated by those who have abundant health (from supernatural safety).
[^backwrite]: my word... making newer rules apply throughout. Possibly I could make revisionistic work. From [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/revisionistic): changing some accepted doctrine or view of history.
[^wives]: Of the underwriting transferring from the husbands to the wives, though it fits with their procedure, I lack having enough experience or knowledge to confirm if it is true.
[^sinning]: Sinning is working against the law of nature. Sins are tools of the political right.

[^Judeo-Christian-Definition]: The typical definition of religion (to mean spiritual practice with an ethereal god) lacks being appropriate here. The Judeo-Christian process to those in the know is a system rather than a religion. Religion was used to disguise it because of many similiar properties.

## The Story of the Moral

Political Right Faults:
1) Sacrifices.
2) Deferring authority---especially during important situations.
3) Overview forsaking, accepting protection from obscure knowledge, act like they know what they are talking about, vanity, "Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.". The political right's knowledge is sparse and often incorrect. One example is using the Hebrew Code in a way that discriminates against the third party. If the perpetuator uses the Hebrew Code in a way that is discriminating, the Jews will reward inclusion (requires audacity usually).
4) Keeping the system silent, "Revenge is a good life". The leaders keep heaven from becoming too obvious.
5) Spiritualism (substituting visceral-ness).
6) Failing to deal with the Jews re-labeling their history.

Unless we all go through it together the excitement that the Jews feel will continue... a feeling of free, an addiction.

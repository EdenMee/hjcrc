* *Civilization is putting the needs of those that need it first, but to be a citizen is fantastical---our leadership has succumbed largely to personal salvation.*

Civilization began as a natural order. 4100 years ago this began to change when human beings reached the top of the food chain. Because the checks on balance were disappearing civilization began to be overlaid with rampant testosterone. The male disposition dominated, empires formed, and the fortunate allied to other fortunates. It was liked so much it got systemized and secreted by the Jewish ancestors. Eventually a repressed female disposition built-up and ~~repelled~~ forced an age of their own. What it has led to today is a system extraordinarily split and mechanized.

* Today, the Jews implement it by rewarding *reaping* acts for an era of fifty years (i.e. taking---usually men).
* Whet this has led to today is a system extraordinarily systemized where their males rule for fifty years followed by a female rule of fifty years.

* Some call this the "human condition".
* Today, it is a large entity in forcing the social construct of the world.

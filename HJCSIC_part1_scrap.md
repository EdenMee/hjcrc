*Civilization is putting the needs of those that require them first but to be a citizen is monumental task, we battle a hierarchy that, addicted to free, has left humanity.*

# How the Judeo-Christian System Influences Civilization [^Information]

![](images/05_ages-of-civilization_eden.svg)![](images/10_cycles-of-heaven.svg)

Civilization began as a natural order. This began to change when human beings reached the top of the food chain 4100 years ago. Because the checks on balance were disappearing civilization began to be dominated by the male disposition. Some males became narcissistic: they focused on personal safety, hoarded all that they could, and allied to other fortunate people. The ancestors of the Jews decided to underwrite them (absent of the narcissists knowing about it [it kept them safer]). The narcissists got spoiled, became immobile in their thinking, infected a number of men (and their spouses) with their audacity, and seized empires. They were people to be feared. This happened for a long age and the underwriters profited well from it. The narcissist age (taking policy) had a devastating effect on civilization. Some people learned of the underwriting and put pressure on the seer (the ancestor's administrator) to stop supporting it. The seer only interested in hiding the profit the male narcissist policy got them was "crafty" and redirected the underwriting from the husbands to the wives. They were to support the *females* who were **selfish**. The seer told the selfish females to reward whomever countered the male narcissist's policy.

To the political left there is only the flood, an addiction, that is all there is. Other people doing well, seeing civilization so devastated, told (strongarmed?) the seer to stop the support of the narcissists. The seer a good business man, the political left's administrator, crafty (a genius), stops the support and even allots the devastated heavenly representation. They take it but a natural reaction follows: they are hurt by the flood and they betray those who flooded. After a long age the narcissists eventually learn of it and are very angry. The seer redirects support back to them. (**After a number of revolutions the seer knowing the anger (even being angry himself?) encourages the female god to give a sacrifice.**). Political right enjoys flood rewards (blindly, of course). Right gets tired of giving sacrifices. Ad infinitum.

This is where the rub is. The narcissists being such big takers, so used to it, addicted to it, when the serpent offered Eve and Adam with heaven the narcissists had to avoided. Because the serpent temped Eve an attraction, because Adam numbly followed, because Cain (who had learned history and was hurt) deceived the entire political left, they angrily called their heaven fake, temporary, considered it a business transaction, a loan to be paid, a debt[^debt].

[^debt]: The Jews sometimes give things (someone may even accidentally acquire a thing) and they will call it a debt even if the recipient lacks being told about it.

"this is hardly sin"

The policy developed to become altruism (giving), then making people think that they restored humanity. It infected many remaining females and their **protectees** . It created a "golden age" and thereafter it revolved to another narcissist's age (to begin a cycle[^switching]). The ages over the centuries grew more extreme, became more systemized, and got secreted by the Jewish ancestors. Today people that know of the system build safety by creating its politics[^politics]. It is extraordinarily split, mechanized, and deadly[^wars]. The Jews maintain it like a vital job. They implement it by rewarding narcissist policy (taking) for an age of fifty years (the political left[^left-right]) followed by rewarding female policy (giving) for an age of fifty years (the political right). A third party also exists who kept exempt from knowing of the system's existence. The Christian church (a succession of the political right) largely practices their beliefs with spiritual principles but is built upon a leadership (formed with the New Testament) that gets safety from the Jews by giving people from the third party as sacrifices. The system forces much of the social construct around the world. I have yet to find anyone who has a sufficient overview on what is happening.

## I May Be Listened to Because...

I am a political prisoner of the Jews. I have been here since I was born (just like Jesus) in 1970. The basic rule is only included people (those that know of the system) get treated fairly, get a share of society. I have been used as a tool by both political sides as a way to refine their policies (immortal rules, that selfish splitting). Some of us are large tools. The neuron-altering bugs vastly hamper my health, my ability, alter my knowledge, and change my feeling. My brain feels mixed up. People avoid me (a repulsion is sent out from my general area). It has been years since I have been able to talk to people. I have yet to have a friend in life. I wonder what realistic help is available. Are people ever going to realize the fantasy of personal safety? I learned what I know now by living most of my life learning, questioning, and reviewing the Jewish hierarchal system as necessary to try and survive.

## My Research Sources are...

The research for this paper is from my experiences but mostly from the Bible. The Bible, the most read book in the world, is where the Jews and Christian leaders document their intent---institutions that have been around awhile usually provide a plan. Both the Jews and the Christians have described their plans in their Testaments. The Old Testament has been refined many times by the Jews because their system is extraordinarily profitable. Though the Testaments fail to be fair declarations with civilization, the Bible does provide insight on what this system is doing to civilization if one is willing to learn the missing history, overcome the graphic representations[^graphic], bypass the entire sections of rubbish, and forgive a very deliberate, clobbering of history (the Old Testament is generically mislabelled to secret the perpetuators). A couple more things: the beginning of the Bible is packed with details; and the Bible was forced by the political right, their side of the story (except for Genesis 1), plus the third party they sometimes represent, the story of societal sliding and human sacrifices.

## Hebrew Code

![](images/15_hebrew-code.svg)The Hebrew people use a code to share secrets with. It is hidden within ordinary language. The base meanings have *absolute* definitions.

## The Story of the Moral

Political Right Faults:
1) Sacrifices.
2) Deferring authority---even during important situations.
3) Overview forsaking, accepting protection from obscure knowledge, act like they know what they are talking about, vanity, "Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.". The political right's knowledge is sparse and often incorrect. One example is using the Hebrew Code in a way that discriminates against the third party. Even if a person lacks knowing if a Hebrew Code is discriminating the Jews will reward them (plus usually audacity).
4) Keeping the system silent, "Revenge is a good life". The leaders keep heaven from becoming too obvious.
5) Spiritualism
6) Leaders failing to deal with the Jews re-labeling their history.

Unless we all go through it together the excitement that the Jews feel will continue... a feeling of free, an addiction.

[^evolved]: It evolved to making civilization think that they restored humanity.
[^switching]: The switching of policy has the effect of relieving its beneficiaries of long-term one-sided policy issues. But each policy lasts so long it is hard to create a balance between the two.
[^wars]: The political right ignorant of some inclusion and hurt by the reckless reaping of the left can declare literal wars with their political counterparts.
[^politics]: Politics comes from the Jews. It is based on policy. There are two policies: male and female (**taking and getting?**). They both last fifty years. Politics is following, enforcing, or adding to the policy of the age/era. Some policies are pretty consistent: pink (right), blood!?(left). Some are shared: Hasbro, Disney, Lego. Some make little sense: the right as gambling and racing; the left has government subsidized cell phones for the poor and government subsidized solar power installations. Most policy is on course: sugar and spice; puppy-dogs... These male/female, usually land of the living values, become less valid with safety (the higher up the hierarchy). Female Jews like the hits on Monday Night Football too. Even deeper, the catalyst is the messiah, the exemption. Whatever misfortune happens to that person, whatever need that person requests of a saved person and to be directly worked against, becomes the new rule.
[^left-right]: Though the definition of political left and right has been around nearly as long as this system (religion) has, it is better defined today as political top and bottom. I'll get more into this later.
[^graphic]: Its graphicness can hide meanings that can only be tolerated by those who have abundant health (from supernatural safety).
[^revisionistic]: From [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/revisionistic): [...] changing some accepted doctrine or view of history.

## Notes

* Describe how the Promoted Mortals (Adam and Eve) reacted. They gave Eden-ites, Adam and Eve, a temporary rule (made them representatives) and allowed them to think they fixed it. It was a temporary safety though, a faux heaven, a temporary free.
* *Personal Salvation*... those that know the detail get the rewards, "get **saved**".
* Mention: Gods immortal/mortal, the "human condition"?
* Because the Jews are *safely* above it all... they get to decide who gets included.
* Safety is coveted in nature. To even be able to depend on it a little is an *addiction*. Having it leads to conservatism, a dispersal of toleration (one fails to see how their safety effects the less fortunate) then bias (beginning to avoid certain people). Safety corrupts civilization.
* The first group's success becomes so **addictive** that they eventually begin cannibalizing on civilization---going after the poor, then creating traps to make people poor. The golden age: eat, drink, and be merry, then sacrificing the poor for protection.
* Their definition of it was literally *heaven*.
* Be wary of the female god---an addiction it is to her too. Females like being on top just as much. Taking feels like success.
* Crafty: Heaven became too obvious. The serpent changed the rewards to females to hide things.
* (The Bible is back-written(revisionistic?[^revisionistic]) so newer rules apply throughout.)
* get "eternal life"

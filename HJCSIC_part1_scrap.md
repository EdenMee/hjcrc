* Civilization began as a natural order.
* This all changed when humans reached the top of the food chain.
  * 
  * Male dominion began to run rampant (some call this the "human condition"), empires formed, and the fortunate became inclusive to only other fortunates. The checks on balance we failed to do. It got systemized by the Jewish ancestors thousands of years ago and then secreted. It was countered eventually by females

Today, the Jews implement it by rewarding *reaping* acts for an era of fifty years (i.e. taking---usually men).

Today, it is a large entity in forcing the social construct of the world.

*Because the Jews assure themselves advantageous lives, because they keep it silent how they do it, because the rewards attracts other people, because the attracted treat people on their heels repellent, because the attraction has grown to influence general behavior, I ask the reader to consider oneself as a citizen negligent.*

# The History of the Judeo-Christian Religion  http://tinyurl.com/HJCR1

![](images/eras-of-civilization_01_eden.svg) Civilization began as a natural order. This all changed when the Judeo-Christian religion started. Civilization moved from belonging to evolution (natural whims) to belonging to those who act according to a prescribed system. The system rewards those that know the details of it. It was started by the Jewish religion and comes from their "Secret of Heaven". The "Secret of Heaven" leads the Jews to demand a dualistic system on civilization (male and female, good and evil, rich and poor...). The system is implemented by rewarding a single side solely for an era of fifty years then rewarding a differing/polar side for an era of fifty years. The alternating partisanship is done as silent as possible; it has resulted in much confusion and encouraged many selfish acts in its 4100 year history (particularly by the less secure second side that can be rewarded for selfishness). The first side the Jews create by rewarding men for selfish acts (male inclusion, a "flood"); from this the Jews get protection. The second side is created by rewarding women (after fifty years) for resting/cover-up/(altruistic?) acts (female inclusion); from this the Jews hide the flood. The Jew sustain the system like a vital job. From it they get authority, advantageous lives, and their definition of it is literally *heaven*. Any person that uses the system is likelier to have successful lives and likelier to keep heaven silent. A third side, the people *left behind*, is nearly overlooked by the "saved". These people can be provided as sacrifices for heavenly inclusion by labeling them as menial. Though most Christians practice their religion with spiritual principles, there exists a female-led side (a succession of the second side) that develops people as *exclusionary* to the Jews for a heavenly share. I have yet to find anyone who has any overview or impartiality on what is happening. These systems have altered the natural order around the planet.

## Why I May Be Listened Of~~, Basic Questions~~

I am one of the people that got used as a sacrifice... *Why are people absent in knowledge about what is happening? Most people would rather prevent themselves from knowing about heaven because they have been encouraged to be selfishness, even ignorantly.* As a sacrifice I have seen many heavenly acts---sometimes selfishly, sometimes to experiment... this has forcibly removed me from civilization. I have seen this for a long time now. I learned what I know by accepting in hard truths when life became too impossible to live reasonably anymore---looking at improbable answers to try and survive. I ask to consider what I write here seriously. *Where are the other informants? The third-side are often too busy trying to survive by the selfishness they are recipient of to assemble much of a scheme.* 

## Research Sources

*Where is the declaration of intent?* Both the Jews and the Christians do! They write out what plan to do with their religion in their Testaments, though cryptically.

Where do these religions discuss their plan? Any lasting institution requires an declaration of intent and both the Jews and the Christians do! They write out what plan to do with their religion in their Testaments, though cryptically. 

The primary source I use is the Bible. It is the most read book in the world. Though the Bible is largely instructions for the Judeo-Christians on how to implement their religion, it does contain some basic history on how the religion was formed. Why is the Bible important? Any lasting institution requires an declaration of intent. These religions promote the Bible to be that---it makes them feel that they have been upfront with civilization. Its very publication makes many in modern civilization feel it means to be honest. It is pre-dominantly what I use as proof. The details found in the Bible (isolated pieces of a large puzzle) once put together help decipher how these religions effect modern civilization. To say it is "fair disclosure" though is false. Because it tells only part of the "Secret of Heaven", and other things, it falls short of that standard.

## The Secret of Heaven

The "Secret of Heaven" comes from before the Bible was written. Absent of knowing the secret the possibility of understanding the beginning of the Bible, the Bible in general, is very small. (Note: The "Secret of Heaven" is real, but how it formed is speculation. It is derived from my limited reading of: History Of Egypt, Chaldea, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria.)

![](images/eras-of-civilization_02_heaven.svg) \
Judaism started because of an environmental threat. The area the religion started in was the Tigris-Euphrates rivers of present-day Iraq---this is where Abraham was from (Gen 11:28-31). The area is surrounded by a lot of desert. Because living in the area was risky (droughts, etc.) it sometimes created desperate men. Some desperate men became dangerous. A desperate man was eventually rewarded silently for protection (the first rewardee given to by the first Hebrew). The desperate man took care of him well. The Hebrew highly valued the protection. The rewarding grew to be periodic (possibly whenever able) for continued protection. *A desperate man being rewarded for personal protection makes it harder for people to give a social conscience to (guilt).* Absent of guilt the life of a desperate man becomes open-bounded and visceral which builds to becoming narcissistic and immobile; after a long enough time he starts divining and even later the insularity builds where the abnormal is required for him to find things interesting. The Hebrews were very afraid of their desperates when the rewarding started---this is what they meant when they said to "Fear God". The protection gotten from this relationship by both Hebrew and desperate man formed a symbiotic relationship that came to be known as the "Secret of Heaven". Later, an era for desperate women was added. The knowledge of how to live a "heavenly" life began to spread over the area.

## The Beginning

The Jews love their religion so much (so protected are they by their narcissists, i.e. desperates) they have become very secretive and spent much time highly refining their Bible with their devices. To the Jews the Bible feels protective by its audacity. A couple of things to know: Genesis here is presented as the beginning of the Jews history, the history though is well along to make it look more polished; and the Bible contains some "backwriting"/is-revisionistic to make newer rules apply throughout.

**Genesis 1** *(He Said, Business, Divining)*: The Bible starts with a desperate man being so rewarded that it refers to him as a "God", "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth (Gen 1:1 NIV)." *Heaven on earth* was such an attraction more work was done (divining, creating Good and Evil): day/night, water/sky, land/sea, sun/moon, man/nature.

**Genesis 2** *(She Said, Rest, Creating Family)*: An era of rest: "By the *seventh* day God had finished the work... so on the *seventh* day [s]he rested." ~~(Could be *she* as the chapters are divided into sexes.)~~ They were fruitful and multiplied: Adam created and Eve created.

**Genesis 3** *(He Said, Business, Divining, Securing Heaven)*: [`Eve too feels that she can think like a real god (hard for me to believe that this is real history, an Edenite) that men should be diviners.`] Eve wants Adam to "be like God" and gives him the "forbidden fruit" (to get him out of Eden, i.e. to get to heaven on earth). Because it was Eve's impetus that made Adam a god, a future directive is added to keep them there (make them become diviners), "...[god] placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life (3:22)".

`Eve too wanted to be a god... too bad it was only for me...`

![](images/eras-of-civilization_03_gold.svg) \
**Genesis 4** *(She Said, Rest, Creating Family---by getting some "saved")*: Eve is the god here and Cain, Abel, and Seth are probably associates of Eve rather than her kin (kin usually get heavenly inclusion). Cain and Abel try to bribe Eve with "fruits" and "fat-portions" so that they can get to heaven. Eve from Eden (Gen 3:23) tries to do heaven like she saw the gods do before her. She too curses her male subjects to "save" them (Gen 3:14-19). She also gives Cain protection, "... anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance *seven* times over." Cain followed the directive where the god before put "cherubim and a flaming sword" and went to the "Land of Nod, east of Eden" (to the new heaven on the right) (`So nonchalantly a new heaven is created, the history appears to say "Everything is OK, a new heaven is fine, little deal---looks like the Jews are trying to make their history look polished.`). 

**Genesis 5** *(Yokel Said, Mortal Rule)*: A time span of ten male rulers from Adam to Noah is defined. God rule decreases as yokel rule becomes more prevalent. Lamech proclaims that Noah is to restore god rule that Adam's (weak!?) rule lost, "[Noah] will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the LORD has cursed (references Gen 3:17)."

**Genesis 6** *(She Said but a dual-power to restore heaven)*: God pronounces a dual-power, "a hundred and twenty years." The "sons of God" (female leaders) sucked up the pride in their own god-ness and mated with the "daughters of humans" (desperate men, angels). This created Nephilim---people that are physical giants, knowing little borders, people to be feared---to create heaven again. The Lord (a female god here) is upset because civilization is co-operative and thoughtful ("wickedness... [and] evil" Gen 6:5) and wants to restore the gods to power. She uses Eden's name (3,5,6) to set-up the exercising of god power, "The ark is to be *three* hundred cubits long, *fifty* cubits wide and *thirty* cubits high. (Gen 6:15).

**Genesis 7** *(He Said, Business, Divining)*: (`The flood is rewarding, in synchronicity, a large number of *desperate* men to create "heaven on earth", divining, creating good and evil. [^flood]`.) The Lord found Noah "righteous" (godly) and he flooded the *earth*, put a*n*imals on the Ark, to restore the gods to power. More using Eden's name for god power, "Noah was six hundred years old...", etc.. (`"The waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days (Gen 6:24)" is used in modern times to denote yearly floods from to January 1 to May 31 (absent a leap year)`).

* The serpent encouraged selfishness.
* The Jews try to make their history look planned here, but the truth is since the Jews keep heaven [the great Jewish two system] always silent, a progressive confusion begins early on the second side. The confusion has created a path for people that start near-sighted and ignorant of complicity but become desperate---a staging heaven to Judaism.
* Became eventually: The women are going to flood too and do it better.
* This directive (Gen 3:22) will develop to: that to become a god a person must do a sin that is unforgivable within civilization to get "saved"... it keeps them silent.
* [^flood]
* "friends (Job 2:11)"
* (narcisstic, desperate)
* it hides the flood

+ Mass Societal Guilt Avoidance
  - Mass Societal Psychlogical Pressure/Reinforcment
+ Zero-sum game and John Nash add.
+ What is heaven? It has come to following the free---a gravity almost all are being pulled to---generally ignorantly. A safety. Can anyone see it clearly.
+ The saved, the right, feel it is more about fighting or avoiding the Jews than listening to the to the people that need it the most.
+ Grand Mistresses/Masters say "It hardly matters how you get here".
+ Those that follow the great two-ism live rich lives---an algorithm invested in heavily by both sides---the great two algorithmic clock.
+ Some people join these societies thinking they will help from there---going through it together is nature's answer.
+ *Satan says, "It is easy to get people to be selfish." (Job ??:??)*
+ Answers that come from the top/heaven/the-gods provide success/safety in the immediacy rather than knowledge that is built naturally/socially over time---the consequences in the future are huge.
+ Heaven is a Pavlovian system that is running away from nature. The rewards outweigh the known/felt consequences.
+ Esther: Where is the five discriminating?
+ Gods invest in two; Edenites invest in one (nature).
+ Heavenly Sins: 1) Protecting gods first and answers come from the saved; ~~2) Disappearing as an answer~~; 3) Eden as expendable/erasable and 4) Beauty having value.
+ Eight abandoned by Jews, now a red herring. The right has claimed it as theirs (7) and hides behind it. Combative right also using it to label Jewish things with (businesses, etc.). It lacks being fair because they have more numbers.
+ ~~Bad behavior feeds them!~~ There is only good behavior. Only good behavior makes civilization.
+ Paradise Lost---:(.
+ ♪ Do I need your civil war? It feeds the rich while it buries the poor. ♪
+ Empathy: sharing a similar feeling because of a similar threat.
+ Saved-people/gods... your perspective is going to make you divine simply by position. By default we want to be righteous, good with nature and others—--only an equal perspective can accomplish that. To help, perspectives like "beauty" and "being saved" need to be left behind.
+ From an honest perspective it is easier to learn that hardness and softness are hardly male and female attributes. Really, they are because the first side (the Jews) got to exercise the Secret of Heaven (and flood) and felt its production and protection (fought and divined); while the second side inherited the protection and were given an age of rest.
+ Safety (as in from heaven, a perspective above nature) breeds conservativeness. Both the Jews and the Right behave so. This conservativeness abandons the people in Eden and puts them in greater danger.
+ If we do a thing that fails to prioritize those that need it the most civilizations (herds) make us feel guilty. Survival requires us to move together as one.
+ We have to go through evolution all together else we will become ignorant of the people left behind.
+ Deperates, How Did They Become So? They need confidence so much and focus entirely on themselves (narcissistic/self-absorbed)---other needs they fail to recognize.
+ Seeing Edenites, naive people, gets the angels excited, and the Jews a feeling of free. Edenites have closer ties to nature and are kept from knowing that others have chosen "heaven on earth" (whether right or left) to get themselves above them. The first side/gods divine and put Edenites in a lower class during the flood, the second side/gods largely ignore them or sin against the Edenites as an offering to regain control after the flood (oops). The second side lacking knowing the great two-ism put us Edenites in increasingly worse danger. Such naivete of the Edenites got the Jews [confident] in such a way that these bugs were built in 1968! The angels/beauties are Pavlonian, guided by many of their era's rewards. The only answer is to keep from feeding them and reward where earned. We Edenites would really appreciate it (♥ free will).
+ The New Testament occurred at a time of a lot of turmoil (the Roman occupation, another flood). Many messiahs were created (Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth, Reza Aslan)---Paul being the foremost, as a baby! (i.e. Paul was likely the lead person they used to create the "How to Deal with Messiahs/Jesus" policy.) Paul choose to avoid heaven I believe (e.g. the three temptations in the wilderness [MT 4:1-11, Luke 4:1-13]) and stayed a part of Eden a good part of his life---even during the "golden age" (in Zealot). The second side had to deal with Paul, his ethics, and it would have been work for them. This [closed the gap] in the Jewish dualism that took 400 years to find an amendable policy---the New Testament, the Christian Church, which agreed to act on people like Paul. The policy: gave fealty to the Jews (MT 1), agreed to provide sacrifices (with some being babies) (MT 2:1-4); and said that those that believe in Jesus (and people like Paul) as sacrifices were absolved of sin. Jerusalem got renamed Aelia Capitolina as part of the turmoil. (This is important history that few know.)
+ The result of the second group fifty-year rule ends up making [laypeople] who have little heavenly knowledge, are naïve, and are exploitable/susceptible. Then the whole cycle is restarted again where the first group *rewardees* are excited by the naïveté of the [laypeople] who are often taken advantage of and used as tools in this battle. I am older and have seen a large number of poor people being used as them---the prescribed fix is false and selfish.
+ The thing to do today is help Job. Help him get a meal... The priority is to help the people that need it the most! Thinking the golden age is yours or being upset with the Jews *are distractions*. To help the people that need it the most is **hard**. We have absconded much! The least fortunate people our our fault for any citizen that wants to see the big picture.
+ The "unforgivable" societal sin that gets people "saved" has the sad effect of changing the doers focus, the focus from compunction for the people that have been sinned of to "anger" toward the predecessors (the Jews). The anger/energy put is really needed by the people left behind.
+ The right being given an era of rest are Pavlonianly rewarded. Since they lack knowing that it is given, they accept the things that they have done during a flood (the Jobism/sins) as having earned it.
* "They made me do it [the left]"---false; began with Job, the right's silent complicity.
* Section: Beauty Myth. Right built upon beauty methodology: vain, superficial, guilt avoiding. "Beautiful (Gen 6:2)". Beautiful also means available.
* Section: Misnomers/Relabeling (6,3)--- errors by both heavens. Attributing heavens actions as Eden's: huge sin.
* The two shapes put together form the Star of David... a physical representation about how these societies formed.
* The battle of the right has become absolutely vicious and scares the people forsaken.
* The angels/beauties narcicism make the rules (if endorsed by the Jews).
* The Jews behavior represents some of their angel's/beauty's behavior. They share some of the visceral that is absent in their safety.
* The left-right heavens a powerful combined partnership/godhead. Angels like David and Bathsheba become very powerful by rewarding extremites.
* Nature is being neglected.
* Golden Ages appear great, but warning, a status quo is forced and they make the Gentiles even more naïve.
* Saved people feel righteous by their protection. What can they do with the temptations of the world which can reward them to keep feeling righteous?
* The flood makes people selfish and the openness of the top of the food chain makes self-judging a temptation.
* Bible chronological, almost perfectly!
* Kafka stating Jewish intent to go to Amerika, Jews define their intent
* Grand Master Leonardo da Vinci: Mona Lisa smiling, Adoration of the Magi, sacred feminine, Knights Templar.
* An example today of answers from the top can be seen in the principle of trickle-*down* economics and Adam Smiths Wealth of Nations.
* Messiah definition: John 3:16: "a begotten son... that whoever that believes in him [messiahs as sacrifices] shall have *eternal life*."
* Safety: an ideal. Have it for a bit and it feels normal---the feeling that makes heaven.
* Right Recruitment Requirements: 1) A battle must be declared on the Jews, and 2) that the modus operandi of this battle is bad behavior(Jobisms).
* Temptations create Gods and corruption.
* "May old acquaintance, be forgot..." Most suicides happen on New Years Eve (yearly flood begins here).
* Svg_jews: 1 to 11! Ruth going to Judah.
* Jack Weiner in Marion Ross book "My Days" said (paraphrase) "Use my name in any way you like".
* Jewish self-interest appears to say, "With such bad behavior, what am I to do with it".
* David began listening to Bathsheba more when she gave up Job? As a rewardee it took more abnormal subjects to interest him!
* gods avoid natural reminders to make them behave.
* To Eden, to us, it feels like a battle on the threes.
* Lacking knowing what was going on Bathsheba started off pretty bad. Desperate she used beauty as an "in". Being separated by her husbands safety/being-a-rewardee she helped created Solomon as a puppet(her own son) as an a confirmation of her aptitude.
* mortal/immortal
* Heaven become too obvious.
* Is Jealously/~~submissiveness~~ created in the women/second-side/right? Because only Adam got out of Eden (**w**-**o**-man?).
* Sin is used as a commodity in this system.
* Artifice is being used to create immortality.
* Narcisstics=Desperates
* A very limited number of Jews know what is going on (know heaven and know the rules).
* Christians your predecessors are the Jews! You are the near-sighted second side. Your bad behavior keeps the poor away!
* What gets a right-winger Grand-Mistress/Master more riled than ethics??
* The right joining in the flood (Gen 6) is hardly part of the great two! So the left will rest during their male era to restore the great two (Gen 9).
* The Christian's messiahs are put in almost inevitable death situations. Since the Jews go as far as to say that men are natural diviners (Gen 4: Eve being supported for putting Cain, Abel, and Seth there from Eden) the Christians labeling some men as expendable (carpenters, walkers on water...) their fates are sure and preferrably ignorable.
* When a messiah (a sacrifice) learns about a heavenly rule then the Gods work directly against him and divine the rule (make good and evil).
* Jobisms: are a great fix now that cause horrible problems later (god fix).
* Jobisms: the right, wanting to believe that Jobisms were good, began telling themselves (*or were led*), that the Jobisms earned them the golden ages.
* Some of te left incites the right---makes them battle the left.
* Thinness demonstrates survivability.
* Politics: How to sacrifice someone, keep it quiet, and get something from it.
* If I am in heaven and I fail to see it, it is my fault.
* Old Title - The History of the Judeo-Christian Religion and How It Effects Civilization
* To me, a messiah, all heavenly acts feel like lateral progression.
* Women that Flood (Eve, Jackeline Kenedy, Long Beach ladies...)
- Desperate females were eventually given their own rule---part of the great Jewish two system. Sadly it can jibe with them since men get to fight and they have an era of rest.
- The Grand Masters/Mistresses say, "It hardly matters how you get here" but what they are really saying is that (for most of us) there will come a time that the rewards of joining will outweigh the consequences of joining. Tiny steps of personal safety will add up over time.
- In nature a species one-ness, always looking out for itself, is key to its survival. Its lack of being noticed by humans (who are at the top of the food chain) has been almost entirely invisible. Few people who are saved (though many may lack knowing they have this protection \[yet on the radar, or someone else is protecting them\]) will be put in a horrible fate where they will be forced to pay attention to what has been left behind and will carry the weight of societies burden. But little fortitude has been seen by me because zero people have accepted that quiet/invisible forces have encouraged them to unknown selfishness. This selfishness manifests itself in pride; that power feels much better responsibility that they may be part of privilege... Eden still exists... barely... in a frayed, manifestations in rare moments, way. \

# Chapters that need to be Integrated

## Heaven Creation: A Male-Ruled, Discrete, Inclusion

These religions are about getting to heaven (heaven on earth). Both religions get to heaven (the Christians mostly ignorantly) by rewarding a desperate man (man originally). The first person rewarded a desperate man and got to heaven, the second person listened to the first person and rewarded a desperate man. The Hebrews rewarded the desperate men so much that the beginning of the Bible refers to a desperate man as a "*God*", "God created the Heavens and the Earth (Gen 1:1)". To a desperate man building "Heaven on Earth" is such an attraction that it is what Adam and Noah did. Adam took the "forbidden fruit" to get out of Eden (Eden = Earth) and Noah rewarded a large number of desperate men (in synchronicity) to flood the Earth (when people became suspicious of heaven). With floods the Hebrews learned they could encourage many people to be *selfish* and hide heaven. Rule became generally male-based. The reacting to a natural environment began to be lost/forgotten. (A desperate man eventually became a diviner (always willing to take more; worried about competition?)).

> Because you simply came before me, oh god, I will give to you so that I may be like you and get higher from it.

## The Lands of Milk and Honey---Part 1 (Conquerors, The Empire Strikes Back, and Abdication/Making-Room-For-Number-One)

The Hebrews found a way to usually survive and likely thrive with the "Secret of Heaven" so they began to populate the area. The Bible describes these \[approaches/encounters\] as male \[routings/invasions\]. Abram took the religion from Chaldea to Canaan (modern-area Israel).

Eventually with Moses it ends up in Egypt (the name of the location is just Hebrew code) where it fails. The people of Egypt deny Moses his flood and Moses has to force his way out of Egypt. While they are stranded in the desert a female affectation begins. When Moses is on the mountain the golden calf appears and people appear to like it. Egypt has affected their religion and Moses (the Hebrews) react badly to it. Basically put: only males can be gods. So the Hebrews do what they always have done when in trouble: divine and get higher. By Moses bringing the 10 commandments down the mountain he is redefining the *Hebrew* definition to now be the *Jews*. The female leaders failed to recognize the separation even to this day.

## Second Heaven Creation (Getting "Saved"): A Female-Ruled, Ignorance-is-Bliss, Exclusion (conservative, more desperate)

(It is going to be hard to believe that "getting saved" is exclusion, but it is---heaven can hardly be heaven if everybody was included.)

Heaven is a Jewish belief-system and is male-led. The females have always misunderstood what heaven is. The fortunate females have gleaned off it and were allowed to join a staging ground to heaven (golden-calf, golden idols...). By Second Samuel heavenly appreciation grows when Bathsheba got to marry King David. Bathsheba was from Eden and was a *desperate female*. She was only married because she was "beautiful". Their son was Solomon and he became king when David died. From the inherited wealth of his father Solomon built many female-supported items: gold-columns, bronze statues... (1 Kings 10).

The female side of Heaven, the second group, the right, gets noticeably conservative/combative by the book of Job. Job, who is in Eden, is being helped by his wife (who is safe in heaven). Satan visits and Bathsheba abandons Job to stay safe, "Everything he has is in your power (Job 1:10-12)." She became selfish because another flood is happening. Following this the wife's family, friends continue her sin on Job and get protection for themselves (Job 1:15-19) (I call these Jobisms). Job was made a sacrifice (for possibly as long as fifty years) until the right get power again. When they get power again, The wife saves Job feeling guilty; she gives him "twice as much as he had before (Job 42:10)". Giving people as sacrifices starts here with the female-led side of Heaven. The *right* for the rest of the Old Testament develop god mythically as a spiritual being. (They have little idea they are part of heaven!?). (The desperate men, later in the Old Testament, are named a*N*gels and a head angel as Satan (Job 1:6 NIV).)

When the *New Testament* is published (the Vulgate, circa 400 A.D.) the right, now the Christian Church, makes a discernable split from the Jews. The New Testament forces four historical changes: 1) an advertisement of the value of supreme sacrifices (e.g. Job and Jesus ^[John 3:16 describes the messiahs well, "\[a\] begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have *everlasting life*."]); 2) an allowance to have sacrifices as babies (MT 2:1-4); 3) a combativeness to begin creating their own angels; and 4) a directive that salvation can come from spirituality alone (e.g. Paul).

## Female Heaven Creation---a Female-Ruled Exclusion

Job's wife becomes desperate and when another flood is happening and heaven is satiated, his wife excludes to keep heavenly recognition. She sacrifices Job and her family, friends... continue her sin against Job so that they can get "saved" (I call these sins Jobisms). Somewhere along here these Jobisms get labeled good because some wanted to believe them so. When around fifty years of the flood pass and many Jobisms the females are given a golden age, fifty years of rest. By the time of Jesus sacrifices has become a planned sacrifices---a sacrifice that can begin as a baby. By 400 A.D. when the *New Testament* is published the feminine-led side of heaven becomes a greater polarity from the Jews. The Jews get zero response when they ask, "We already settled this in the Old Testament!?".

## The Lands of Milk and Honey---Conquerors, Part 2

When the Roman Empire comes, sacrifices (messiahs) begin to get created in large numbers. The Romans themselves are largely naïve. This naiveté has always got the Jew's desperates excited and the Jews themselves protection and wealth. Instead the conquerors become the conquered. The Jewish selfish-system invades into Rome---the new land of Milk and Honey. The Roman Empire breaks up from the inside-out. The new land after that is the German empire---the Roman conquerors. Just before WWII when Germany became satiated with Jews and a tolerance wears thin the Jew move to Amerika in large numbers (a have a source for this?).

Through all this until today, the right has remained largely naïve. Getting saved is the reward (or even avoiding the Jews) rather than civilization development. Their knowledge is basic: 2 is legit, 3 is illegitimate, that getting "saved" is the answer, that the things the right gives to the Jews got back better things (companies, symbols, partnerships...), and that "never again" (Gen 9:11) will we allow floods, etc.. After fifty years of this bad behavior by the right, again and again, they will be rewarded by the Jews and they will get their golden age. Their perspective has them build a safety by forcing a status quo in the golden age, that only makes the Gentiles more naïve (exactly what the left wants). And after fifty years of a golden age the disgruntled, desperate men will complain to the super-healthy Jews of the frivolous women and companies that get sued... and a new flood will be started (akin to circa 1970: Bugs in the Nixon White House, and [end of the golden age in Hollywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tate%E2%80%93LaBianca_murders)).

![](images/eras-of-civilization_04_jews.svg) The "With such bad behavior, what am I to do with it?" is what the Jews appear to say. The Jobisms continue to this day... they are called at times "have to do bad to do good". The right has taken over many aspects of heaven creation: messiah creation, angel creation, and muck control. To me it looks like "aiming to please", to the right they believe that controlling every aspect of evil creation will give them the power they finally need to win their battle.

## The Story of the Moral

* If we fail to go through it together, evolve together, the revolutions continue. These Jobisms truly only help those that do them. Right: forcing their way in. **Socially necessary information** never again *cycle of poverty*.
* 50 years right has always thought that giving to left will reach satiation ([American Made](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3532216/))
* Creating gods -- He and She God competition, battle of the fatfaces, good for the people that are part of the battle.
* Vegetarian importance---odd to the new---respect for all life can get us to Eden again.
* complicit
* A desperate man being constantly rewarded builds in time an insularity where more abnormal feelings are required for him to find things interesting. And from this insularity his behavior begins to wear on civilization's standards. He becomes so immobile that when the Hebrews say to "fear God"... this is what they mean.

## Who Am I? ^[[Git](https://github.com/EdenWise/hjcrc) \| [@](mailto:toddpartridge@outlook.com)]

I apologize for having to bring forward such a tough topic. There is a battle going on. It really is more of a grabbing of power by those failing to realize others are being left behind---the male versus female gods (very literally). When lacking helping those that need it most, gods develop. The gods use the desperates and the beauties as tools/pawns to progress their side of heaven. The desperates and beauties get rewarded falsely (lacking earning it) to be used as vessels for that progress. The Jews who organize it have safety, the gods do too, their desperates and beauties have safety (as long as the gods chose to do so), but the people left behind in Eden have to live in the [wastelands] and as political tools. Some people of Eden are even designated sacrifices, like Jesus. It may be hard to believe but I am one of these people. Us messiahs have zero story that gets recorded, have zero story to learn from, and are used by the right as sacrifices to create their side of heaven (like Job). The female gods have lacked wanting to deal with the male gods and are submissive so they have learned that by giving up sacrifices like Job and Jesus that they get power too. I am one of these people. And this is hardly a short story, I have been here all my life. I have seen some other sacrifices in my life journey and these stories are too disturbing to talk about. I wonder what type of faith to have in all this. It has been this way for 4100 years. I feel truly alone and have zero idea if there will ever be any representation for us. Zero people in my life story have I discovered that truly know what is going on.

The battle in heaven produces a selfish splitting of safety. The saved (ignorant or known) have a protective buffer. This buffer causes a general conservatism and when in danger conservatisms grows into artifice. The saved feel it is more about avoiding the Jews than to listening to those that need it the most, the poor. We are all from Eden. The people of Eden, bound to nature, see conservatisms as selfish and artifices as dangerous. Our realities are surrounded in fear. People are being forced to be saved. Flood push people to be selfish/heaven. After 4100 years of them a general behavior of self-positioning exists.

# The History of the Judeo-Christian Religion and How It Effects Civilization---Part 1 [^1]

![align fails](media/eras-of-civilization_01_eden.svg) Civilization began as a natural order. All this changed when the religions of Judaism and Christianity started. Civilization moved from group-evolution and natural whims to safety being held/hoarded by individualists-salvationists who develop an artificial society. This selfishness is a result of the Jewish religion who have used the "secret of heaven" to get profitable lives for themselves. The "secret of heaven" leads them to forcing a dualistic formula on society/[civilazation?] (good and evil, male and female, rich and poor...). They impose this formula by rewarding/~~invest in~~ a single side solely for a span of fifty years—then alternating. This secret partisianship/patronage/subsidizing gets them influence in that society. With the good lives they get from it they sustain it like a vital job and they literally define it as "heaven". Because the Jews keep all this a secret both groups fight for inclusion that has led to today being a huge war between them. <u>For the first fifty years, the first group, men mainly, the Jews, reward those who produce/implement "secret of heaven" tasks for them (*rewardees*).</u> For the following fifty years, the second group, the female-led group, the less knowledgeable but still protected group (their wives and other self-deserving-people/boasters), are allowed the rule; as a "golden age" they reward resting and guess at how to implement the "secret of heaven" (even get misdirected) while the Jews try to keep a status quo. The result of the second group fifty-year rule ends up making laypeople who have little heavenly knowledge, are naïve, and are exploitable/susceptible. When the whole cycle is restarted where the first group *rewardees* are excited by the naïveté of the laypeople who are often taken advantage of and used as tools in this battle. I am older and have seen a large number of poor people being used as them---the prescribed fix is superficial and ultimately selfish. The more a person uses this dualistic formula (and a fair number of people besides the Jews do these days) the likelier they are to have good lives and the likelier they are to keep heaven secret. The Christians are an \[evolution\] the second group whose leadership has dedicated fealty/allegiance to the Jews (MT 1) and have been largely permeated by this selfishness; they are complicit by providing sacrifices (mainly) to get protection. (Note: a number of Christians appear mostly ignorant of it). I have yet to find anyone who has any lasting knowledge or overview on what is happening. These systems have altered the natural order all around the planet.
     

The Christians have bought their way into this system; the most important are: fealty (MT 1); and by select key figures providing sacrifices.

## Why I May Be Listened Of

I am one of the people that lacked knowing what these systems were doing and got used by a system as a puppet. Because of this many things in my life are influenced to be deceiving. The game is the focus and I am overlooked of how I feel. I have been here all my life and have been forced to the under-class/inadequate/riff-raff of society. During all this time I have tried to figure out what is going on. This is all I can say right now to make this believable.

## The Source of Research and What It Is

Any lasting operation requires a *feeling* (at least) of "fair disclosure". The Bible is that representation for these religions. It is the most read book in the world. The reason for its publication is that earlier societies had enough ethic push to make them do so. Its very publication makes many in modern society feel it is forthcoming to the Jews it feels protective (by its audacity). It is pre-dominantly what I use as proof. The details found in the Bible (isolated pieces of a large puzzle) once put together decipher what these religions are doing with modern society. To say it is "fair disclosure" is largely true but because it tells only part of the "secret of Heaven" it falls short.

The Bible is more instructions of how to execute their religion than it is a history...

## The Secret of Heaven

The "secret of Heaven" comes from before the Bible was written. The beginning of the Bible is a steep ledge absent knowing the secret. It is also important because the secret makes the Bible and society progressively drift over time.

Judaism started because of an environmental threat. The area the religion started in was the Tigris-Euphrates rivers of present-day Iraq---this is where Abraham was from (Gen 11:28-31). The area is surrounded by a lot of desert. Because living in the area was risky (droughts, etc.) it sometimes created desperate men. Some desperate men became dangerous. A desperate man was eventually rewarded for protection (the first rewardee given to by the first Hebrew). The desperate man took care of him well. The Hebrew highly valued the protection. The rewarding grew to be periodic (possibly whenever able) for continued protection. ~~A desperate man being constantly rewarded allows him the luxury of always being able to use his sexual hormone for answers.~~ A desperate man being constantly rewarded makes it harder for people to give guilt to them, a social conscience; absent of guilt the reward becomes pleasure. It gives these guys immobility of feeling—this turns out to be very powerful; when the Hebrews say to "Fear God" this is what they mean. The protection the Hebrew and desperate person got formed a discrete and symbiotic relationship that came to be known as the "secret of Heaven". Both are well rewarded and protected to this day.

## Heaven Creation: A Male-Ruled, Discrete, Inclusion

![](media/eras-of-civilization_02_heaven.svg)These religions are about getting to heaven (heaven on earth). Both religions get to heaven (the Christians mostly ignorantly) by rewarding a desperate man (man originally). The first person rewarded a desperate man and got to heaven, the second person listened to the first person and rewarded a desperate man. The Hebrews rewarded the desperate men so much that the beginning of the Bible refers to a desperate man as a "*God*", "God created the Heavens and the Earth (Gen 1:1)". To a desperate man building "Heaven on Earth" is such an attraction that it is what Adam and Noah did. Adam took the "forbidden fruit" to get out of Eden (Eden = Earth) and Noah rewarded a large number of desperate men (in synchronicity) to flood the Earth (when people became suspicious of heaven). This is why the Hebrew said to "Fear God". With floods the Hebrews learned they could encourage many people to be *selfish* and hide heaven. Rule became male-based and encouraged a general hardness. The reacting to a natural environment began to be lost/forgotten.

## The Lands of Milk and Honey---Part 1 (Conquerors, The Empire Strikes Back, and Abdication/Making-Room-For-Number-One)

![](media/eras-of-civilization_03_gold.svg)The Hebrews found a way to usually survive and likely thrive with the "secret of Heaven" so they began to populate the area. The Bible describes these \[approaches/encounters\] as male \[routings/invasions\]. Abram took the religion from Chaldea to Canaan (modern-area Israel).

Eventually with Moses it ends up in Egypt (the name may just be metaphorical) where it fails. The people of Egypt deny Moses his flood and Moses has to force his way out of Egypt. While they are stranded in the desert the first female affectation begins. When Moses is one the mountain the golden calf appears and people appear to like it. Egypt has affected their religion and Moses (the Hebrews) react badly to it. Basically put: only males can be gods. So the Hebrews do what they always have done when in trouble: separate-and-disappear/divide-and-get-higher. By Moses bringing the 10 commandments down the mountain he is redefining the Hebrew definition to now be the Jews. The female leaders failed to recognize the separation even to this day.

## Second Heaven Creation (Getting "Saved"): A Female-Ruled, Ignorance-is-Bliss, Exclusion (conservative, more desperate)

(It is going to be hard to believe that "getting saved" is exclusion, but it is---heaven can hardly be heaven if everybody was included.)

Heaven is a Jewish society and is male-led. The females have always misunderstood what heaven is. The fortunate females have gleaned off it and started a similar female-led society (golden-calf, golden idols...). By Second Samuel heavenly recognition begins to be forced when Bathsheba got to marry King David. Bathsheba was from Eden and was a *desperate female*. She was only married because she was "beautiful". Their son was Solomon and he became king when David died. From the inherited wealth of his father Solomon built many female-supported items: gold-columns, bronze statues... (1 Kings 10).

The female side of Heaven, the second group, the right, gets noticeably conservative/combative by the book of Job. Job, who is in Eden, is being helped by Bathsheba (Job 1:10) (Bathsheba is "God" here). Satan visits and Bathsheba abandons Job to stay safe, "Everything he has is in your power (Job 1:10-12)." She became selfish because another flood is happening. Following this Bathsheba's family, friends continue her sin on Job and get protection for themselves (Job 1:15-19). Job was made a sacrifice (for possibly as long as fifty years) that helps the right get power again. When they get power again, Bathsheba saves Job feeling guilty; she gives him "twice as much as he had before (Job 42:10)". Giving people as sacrifices inaugurates the female-led side of Heaven. The *right* for the rest of the Old Testament develop god mythically as a spiritual being. (They have little idea they are part of heaven!?) . (*The desperate men, later in the Old Testament, are named angels and a head angel as Satan (Job 1:6 NIV).*)

When the *New Testament* is published (the Vulgate, circa 400 A.D.) the right, now the Christian Church, makes a discernable split from the Jews. The New Testament forces four historical changes: 1) an advertisement of the value of supreme sacrifices (e.g. Job and Jesus[^2]); 2) an allowance to have sacrifices as babies (MT 2:1-4); 3) a combativeness to begin creating their own angels; and 4) a directive that salvation can come from spirituality alone (e.g. Paul).

(Tip: The mislabeling of angels as threes begins somewhere near hear. Angels henceforth in Christian history are now labeled from the Magi (or commonly called the Three Wise Men). This misnomer was caused by the paranoia the flood creates. BTW "flood" itself is a mislabeling too. This has serious historical/mortal significance: it has almost entirely blocked the visibility of the messiahs.

~~(Tip: A physical representation of how these societies formed has already been mapped---to see it, combine the two symbols above.)~~

## Female Heaven Creation---a Female-Ruled Exclusion

![](media/eras=of-civilization_04_jews.emf)Heaven is a male institution but the females (who found it impossible to understand the male secrets in their hardness) begin forcing their way in. Bathsheba the first notable female desperate marries King David. When another flood is happening and heaven is satiated, Bathsheba excludes to get heavenly recognition. She sacrifices Job and gets herself "saved". Bathsheba's family, friends... continue her sin against Job so that they can get "saved" (I call these sins Jobisms). Somewhere along here these Jobisms get labelled good because some wanted to believe them so. When around fifty years of the flood pass, of many Jobisms, and likely King David dying, the females force their own heaven. The she-gods are formed and fifty years of a golden age begin (a softness). The floods and Jobisms continued on to Jesus who has become a planned sacrifice, a sacrifice that can begin as a baby. By 400 A.D. when the *New Testament* is published the feminine-led side of heaven tries to separate definitively from the Jews. The Jews get zero response when they ask, "We already settled this in the Old Testament!?".

## The Lands of Milk and Honey---Conquerors, Part 2

When the Roman Empire comes, sacrifices (messiahs) begin to get created in large numbers. The Romans themselves are largely naïve. This naiveté has always got the Jew's desperates excited and the Jews themselves protection and wealth. Instead the conquerors become the conquered. The Jewish selfish-system invades into Rome---the new land of Milk and Honey. The Roman Empire breaks up from the inside-out. The new land after that is the German empire---the Roman conquerors. Just before WWII when Germany became satiated with Jews and a tolerance wears thin the Jew move to Amerika in large numbers (a had a source for this).

Through all this until today, the right has remained largely naïve. Getting saved is the reward (or even avoiding the Jews) rather than civilization development. Their knowledge is basic: 2 is legit, 3 is illegitimate, that getting "saved" is the answer, that the things the right gives to the Jews got back better things (companies, symbols, partnerships...), and that "never again" (Gen 9:11) will we allow floods, etc.. After fifty years of this bad behavior by the right, again and again, they will be rewarded by the Jews and they will get their golden age. Their perspective has them build a safety by forcing a status quo in the golden age, that only makes the Gentiles more naïve (exactly what the left wants). And after fifty years of a golden age the disgruntled, desperate men will complain to the super-healthy Jews of the frivolous women and companies that get sued... and a new flood will be started (akin to circa 1970: [The Pentagon Papers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagon_Papers), Bugs in the Nixon White House, and [end of the golden age in Hollywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tate%E2%80%93LaBianca_murders)).

The "With such bad behavior, what am I to do with it?" is the Jews entire policy to this day. The Jobisms continue to this day... they are called at times "have to do bad to do good". The right has taken over many aspects of heaven creation: messiah creation, angel creation, and muck control. To me it looks like "aiming to please", to the right they believe that controlling every aspect of evil creation will give them the power they finally need to win their war (or possibly make it look like).

## The Story of the Moral

• If we fail to go through it together, evolve together, the revolutions continue. These Jobisms truly only help those that do them. Right: forcing their way in. **Socially necessary information** never again cycle of poverty

• 50 years right has always thought that giving to left will reach satiation ([American Made](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3532216/))

• Creating gods -- He and She God competition, battle of the fatheads, good for the people in the know

• Vegetarian importance---odd to the new---respect for all life complicit the gods are to what degree is the question\
• A desperate man being constantly rewarded builds in time an insularity where the abnormal is required for him to find things interesting. And from this insularity his behavior begins to wear on society's standards. He becomes so immobile that when the Hebrews say to "fear God"... this is what they mean.

## Who Am I?

I apologize for having to bring forward such a tough topic. There is a war going on. It really is more of a grabbing of power by those failing to realize others are being left behind---the male versus female gods (very literally). When lacking helping those that need it most, gods develop. The gods used the desperates and the beauties as tools/pawns to progress their side of heaven. The desperates and beauties get rewarded falsely (lacking earning it) to be used as vessels for that progress. The Jews who organize it have safety, the gods do too, their desperates and beauties have safety (as long as the gods chose to do so), but the people left behind in Eden have to live by fate. Some people of Eden are even designated sacrifices, like Jesus. It may be hard to believe but I am one of these people. Us messiahs have zero story that gets recorded, have zero story to learn from, and are used by the right as sacrifices to create their side of heaven (like Job). The female gods have lacked wanting to deal with the male gods who become hard by the floods so they have learned that by giving up sacrifices like Job and Jesus that they are hardly people to be messed with. I am one of these people. And this is hardly a short story, I have been here all my life. I have seen some other sacrifices in my life journey and these stories are too disturbing to talk about. I wonder what type of faith to have in all this. It has been this way for 4100 years. I feel truly alone and have zero idea if there will ever be any representation for us. Zero people in my life story have I discovered that truly know what is going on.

The war in heaven is really a selfish splitting of safety. The saved (ignorant or known) have a protective buffer. This buffer causes a general conservatism and when in danger conservatisms grows into artifice. The saved feel it is more about avoiding the Jews than to listening to those that need it the most, the poor. We are all from Eden. The people of Eden, bound to nature, see conservatisms as selfish and artifices as dangerous. Our realities are surrounded in fear. People are being forced to be saved. Flood push people to be selfish/heaven. After 4100 years of them a general behavior of self-positioning exists. (The Jews discriminated the Edenites in the book of Esther.)

## Notes

• Angels work on people's misunderstanding.

• Introduction: • g*od games---define all as a game? Playing? Using pawns? Zero-sum game? • heaven has evolved to: following the free, a gravity pulling everybody ~~These religions are about getting "saved"---a fixed, synthetic, perspective-based, ignorant-of-fairness comfort. All people are~~ **gravitating toward this safety**~~, few can see it~~ **clearly**. The people that fail to understand "heaven" get the Jewish rewardees excited. What is heaven? It has graduated to following free. Following the free---the gravity all are being pulled to • godhead*

• "Cause you simply came before me (oh god), I will give to you so that I may be like you and get higher from it.

• Desperate females were finally given their own rule, part of the great Jewish TWO system.

~~Male desperate when met a desperate female said:~~

-   ~~Women can hardly rule.~~

-   ~~Are pushovers.~~

> ~~• This spurned:~~

-   ~~Obstinate, female god wanted it her own way (tried to make her own rules, and largely did) but had to take what was left~~

-   ~~Was rewarded for being misdirected by Jews/male-desperate. (Abram's Sarai from the start; this misdirection would help heaven from becoming too obvious.)~~

-   Phht... Jewish two system: males first: directed; females second: misdirected, submissive (Gen 3:16)

• "They made me do it (the left)"---false; began with Job, started by right.

• Right: built from beauty methodology: vain, superficial, guilt avoiding.

• The two shapes put together form the Star of David... a physical representation about how these societies formed.

• The war of the right has become combative and scares the people left behind

• The Christians create the angels; the angels make the rules (if endorsed by the **J**ews).: Bathsheba is accepted*, they reward divinity*, and also (hush-hush) mislead the secrets.

• The Jews make themselves invisible (in presence). Their behavior represents their angel (another's behavior) and hence are amused at being called evil.

\+ Saved feel it is more about avoiding Jews that listening to poor.

\+ Christians are about getting "saved", Grand Mistresses/Masters say "It hardly matters how you get here."

\+ Those that follow the great two-ism live rich lives---an algorithm invested in heavily by both sides---the great two algorithmic clock

• The left-right heavens has become a very collaborative (ignorantly) partnership/godhead. Guided by the Jews David and Bathsheba benefit their own personal selfishness's.

• Nature is being neglected

• The right and its temerity---sacrifices, baby sacrifices, zero full-view, status quo, conservatism, saved, rewarding naïve spiritualism

• Golden Ages appear great, but warning, a status quo is forced and they make the Gentiles even more naïve.

\+ Some people join these societies thinking they will help from there... going through it together is nature's answer.

• Getting "saved" tell those that do that they have joined the answers, superficial answers start to become accepted.

• Zero people "know" what is going on. Answers that come from the top provide safety in the immediacy rather than knowledge that is built naturally/socially over time.

• The flood makes people selfish and the openness of the top of the food chain makes self-judging possible.

• ~~People have gravitated to **sex hormones** for an added (drugged) sense of worth instead of reacting to environmental stimuli.~~

• Bible chronological, almost perfectly!

• Satan says, "It is easy to get people to be selfish." (Job ??:??)

• right naïve, fighting to get first group off heels, has been more about protecting themselves rather than getting an overview or an inclusion of Eden

• Land(s) of Milk and Honey - Kafka stating Jewish intent to go to Amerika, Jews define their intent

• John Nash and zerosum **game** (it is a game---those that play it have rich lives)

• Grand Master: Leonardo da Vinci, Mona Lisa smiling, Adoration of the Magi, sacred feminine, Knights Templar

• Esther: where is the 5 diminishing?

• An example today can be seen in the principle of trickle-down economics. Adam Smiths Wealth of Nations---answers from the top.

• Messianic definition: <https://www.britannica.com/topic/messiah-religion>

• Jacob and Esau • The Old Testament is sort of the story of one royal line; more like instructions on how to get to heaven.

• Grand master, "By doing all these wrong things to you, I can teach you the right direction."

• Grand Master, "Hardly matters how you get here. \[Just matters that you do\]."

• Grand Master and the wrongs by the right

• Gods are investing in two; Edenites invest in one (nature) and their naivete gets the gods excited.

• Safety: an ideal, heaven has created a feeling that it is normal.

• Heavenly Sins: 1) Protecting gods first and answers come from the saved; 2) Disappearing as an answer; 3) Eden as erasable and 4) Beauty as value

• Right Recruitment Requirements: 1) War must be declared on the Jews, and 2) that the M.O. of this war is bad behavior, evil exclusion.

• Symbol add Good and Evil, tree of Life?

• Temptations create Gods and corruption

• Eight abandoned by Jews, some, many(?) still assume its theirs -- combative right using it to build sin/affiliation/protection: red herring, bad businesses

• **Right assumes: angel creation, muck control, aims to please (males?!?)**

• "May old acquaintance, be forgot..." Most injuries happen on New Years Eve (yearly flood begins here)

• Right always creating extreme male artifice 88ing, looks like, is?!, a competition, it is the bad behavior, rewarded for it

• Svg_jews: 1 to 11! Ruth going to Judah.

• Jack Weiner in Marion Ross book "My Days" said (paraphrase) "Use my name in any way you like".

• Angels in old times (today?!?) lost wives!?! (Ruth #:#)

\+ "\[an angel\] must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever." (Gen 3:22)---paraphrase, "All who leave Eden fail to go back to it".

• It looks like during golden ages and their status quos that messiahs are used more intensely and kept more quiet.

• Calling 3's angels: bad behavior---both right and left doing it.

\+ Bad behavior feeds them

• ~~Misnomers/relabeling: errors by right---scared by the flood: flood, flood and Magi mean zip.~~ Reattributing heavens actions as Eden's: huge sin.

• The secret of Heaven today is mostly emoted.

• Later when heaven became satiated the desperate people became diviners.

• Paradise Lost • section: Beauty Myth? • section: six misnomer myth

• A Pavlovian system for the men-in-the-know, they are given to for supplication

• ~~"With such bad behavior, what am I to do with it" has always been policy to them.~~

• David began listening to Bathsheba more when she gave up Job?! ---as a rewardee it took more abnormal subjects to interest him

• gods lack rules to bind them. gods make their own reality. • to us it feels like a war on the threes

Seeing fools, ignorant people gets the angels/Jews excited---a feeling of free. These are people that are still of nature, that lack knowing that others have chosen heaven on earth, to get themselves personally saved. The saved male leaders take the free, the saved females (the right) knows jack (sorry) get to lead a golden age and claims, "never again". They use sin to get control during the flood (and likely elsewhere) sacrifice people, and even blaspheme the Jews. The Jews have a philosophy, "With such bad behavior~~, what am I to do with it~~, I must reward it!" Such naivete of Eden gets the Jews excited in such a way that these bugs were built in 1968. The Jews hold the upmost confidence, investors in desperate males for fifty years and then in desperate females for fifty years. ~~The only answer though is to keep from feeding them, to only show the people that need it most support, because we do, we can help.~~

*In nature a species one-ness, always looking out for itself, is key to its survival. Its lack of being noticed by humans (who are at the top of the food chain) has been almost entirely invisible. Few people who are saved (though many may lack knowing they have this protection \[yet on the radar, or someone else is protecting them\]) will be put in a horrible fate where they will be forced to pay attention to what has been left behind and will carry the weight of societies burden. But little fortitude has been seen by me because zero people have accepted that quiet/invisible forces have encouraged them to unknown selfishness. This selfishness manifests itself in pride, importance to the community; that power feels much better responsibility that they may be part of privilege... Eden still exists... barely... in a frayed, manifestations in rare moments, way.*

*The Jews only see the system entailing the most desperate people. Because it is male-led (?) they usually choose male desperates. Originally (today?) the existence of 7's, 2's is rewarded because of the bad-doings surrounding it.*

• The games the gods play, the naivete get them to become extremely sexual.

![](media/hear-see-speak-zero-evil.svg)• Lacking knowing what was going on Bathsheba started off pretty bad. Desperate she used beauty as an "in". Being separated by her husbands safety/being-a-rewardee she helped Job as an affrontation(?), self-affirmation(?).

• Do I need your civil war?\...

• The desperate people are willing to separate.

• All animals want to believe that what is good for themselves are the right actions.

• Empathy: sharing a similar feeling because of a similar threat.

• We have to go through evolution all together else we will become ignorant of the people left behind.

• Hardness and softness are hardly male and female attributes! They are because the first group (the Jews) got to exercise the secret of heaven (and flood) and felt its production and got audacious. The second group, starting with the wives, inherited the protection, and learned submissiveness/conservativeness as a way to survive. (Softness/submissiveness... becomes passion during their allowed/fooled rule—the great Jewish two, the flooders had to rest)

• Saved-people/gods... your perspective is going to give you divisiveness simply by position; by default we want to feel righteous/good-with-nature so a higher perspective will overlook feeling guilty.

• mortal/immortal

• Deperates, How Did They Become So?

-   > They lose faith in people and subordinate the less fortunate to feel stronger

-   > They need confidence in themselves so they use powerful tools if available.

-   > They need confidence and focus entirely on themselves (narcissism), others needs they fail to realize as part of something that they may work with (and becoming less necessary as heavenly people progressively reward desperates to get protection).

• Heaven become too obvious.

• Jealously was created in the women/second-group---only Adam got out of Eden.

• The right makes it look like a war with the Jews but it is more of a pretense for those that feel safer. The safety they have makes them more able to live in artifice; the war is a front to "getting saved" or avoid feeling guilty.

• The Bible says salvationists/gods always stay in heaven (Gen 3:22-24)

• Bible: Ruth *her* story, Samuel *his* story?!

• Curse God—done by Harry Reid with Jesus and "Why hast though forsaken me?", also was encouraged to do to Job (by wife) (something like, "Job why do you not curse God?")

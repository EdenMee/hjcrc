# The History of the Judeo-Christian Religion and How It Effects Civilization---Part 1 ^[<http://tinyurl.com/HJCR1>]

![](images/eras-of-civilization_01_eden.svg) Civilization began as a natural order. All this changed when the Judeo-Christian religion started. Civilization moved from species-evolution and natural whims to safety belonging to individualists/salvationists who develop a fantastical world. This self-absorption is a result of the Jewish religion. It comes from their "Secret of Heaven". With it the Jews to force on civilization a dualistic formula (good and evil, male and female, rich and poor...). Using it wrests them authority in civilization and gives them advantageous lives. This formula is implemented by rewarding a single side solely for an era of fifty years, then rewarding a differing/polar side for fifty years. For 4100 years this alternating-partisanship has been kept silent which has encouraged many selfish acts and has led to fighting by both sides (particularly by a retaliatory second side). The first side is made of chosen desperate men (a "flood" [explained later]). The second side is made of rewarded desperate females who are silently pressurized to support an era of rest (to hide the "flood"). (`The second side ends up being a staging ground to Judaism for near-sighted/ignorant-of-complicity people.`) From this discrete alternating-partisanship the Jews get rich/successful lives, they sustain it like a vital job, and their definition of it is literally "heaven". The more a person uses this dualistic formula (and a fair number of people do these days besides the Jews) the likelier they are to have successful lives and the likelier they are to keep heaven silent. There is also a third side that is nearly overlooked amid the [saved]---the people who are absent heavenly inclusion (laypeople/secular?). These people fight desperately for attention, can get abandoned by the "saved", and can be used as puppets/pawns for better heavenly recognition. The Christians, a succession of the second side, are ignorant of their inclusion in heaven I believe. The leadership of the Christians though **has** bought a place into heaven largely by providing people as sacrifices (to the Jew's desperate/narcissistic men). I have yet to find anyone who has any overview or impartiality on what is happening. These systems have altered the natural order around the planet.

## Why I May Be Listened Of

I am one of the people that lacked knowing what these sides were doing and got used by a side as a puppet. Because of this many things in my life are worked directly against as part of a battle. The focus is the battle and I am overlooked of how this affects my life. I have been here all my life and have been forcibly removed from civilization. During all this time I have tried to figure out what is going on. To make this document believable this is all I can say right now.

## The Source of Research

The primary source I use is the Bible. It is the most read book in the world. Though the Bible is largely instructions for the Judeo-Christians on how to implement their religion, it does contain some basic history on how the religion was formed. Why is the Bible important? Any lasting operation requires a *feeling* of "fair disclosure". For these religions the Bible is that representation. It makes these religions feel that they have been upfront with civilization. Its very publication makes many in modern civilization feel it is forthcoming. It is pre-dominantly what I use as proof. The details found in the Bible (isolated pieces of a large puzzle) once put together help decipher how these religions effect modern civilization. To say it is "fair disclosure" though is false. Because it tells only part of the "Secret of Heaven", and other things, it falls short of that standard.

* By its audacity the Bible feels protective to the Jews.
* Warning: the Bible does contain [backwriting] to make newer rules apply throughout.
* Warning: The Jews love their religion so much, being so protected by their desperates/narcissists, they have become very cerebral and have spent much time highly refining their Bible with their devices.

## The Secret of Heaven

The "Secret of Heaven" comes from before the Bible was written. The beginning of the Bible is a steep ledge absent knowing the secret. It is also important because the secret makes the Bible and civilization progressively drift over time.

![](images/eras-of-civilization_02_heaven.svg) (*The "Secret of Heaven" is true but how it formed is speculation. It is derived from my limited reading of: History Of Egypt, Chaldea, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria.*) Judaism started because of an environmental threat. The area the religion started in was the Tigris-Euphrates rivers of present-day Iraq---this is where Abraham was from (Gen 11:28-31). The area is surrounded by a lot of desert. Because living in the area was risky (droughts, etc.) it sometimes created desperate men. Some desperate men became dangerous. A desperate man was eventually rewarded discretely for protection (the first rewardee given to by the first Hebrew). The desperate man took care of him well. The Hebrew highly valued the protection. The rewarding grew to be periodic (possibly whenever able) for continued protection. *A desperate man being constantly rewarded makes it harder for people to give a social conscience to (guilt).* Absent of guilt the life of a desperate man becomes very open-bounded, and visceral which builds to becoming narcissistic/immobile; after a long enough time they start divining and even later the insularity builds where the abnormal is required for him to find things interesting. When the rewarding started the Hebrews were very afraid of their desperates; when they said to "Fear God" this is what they meant. The protection gotten from this relationship by both Hebrew and desperate person formed a symbiotic relationship that came to be known as the "Secret of Heaven". "The Secret of Heaven" began to spread over the area.

* escalated to "most desperate" men?!

## The Beginning

***Genesis 1 (He Said, Work as Divining)***: The Bible starts with a desperate man being rewarded so much that it refers to him as a "God", "In the beginning God created the *heavens* and the *earth*." He does more divining to get higher: day/night, water/sky, land/sea, sun/moon, man/nature.

***Genesis 2 (She Said, Rest for Family)***: (**Since the second side lacks knowing about the great Jewish two-system a lot of confusion is shown by them about what heaven is.**) An era of rest: "By the *seventh* day God had finished the work... so on the *seventh* day [s]he rested." (Could be *she* as the chapters are divided into sexes). They were fruitful and multiplied: Adam created, Eve created, and Garden of Eden created.

***Genesis 3 (He Said, Work as Divining, Securing Heaven)***: [Hard for me to believe this is real history but... Eve too thinks that men should be diviners:] Eve wants Adam to "be like God". She encourages him eat the "forbidden fruit" to get out of Eden (get to heaven on earth). Since Gods should only belong to heaven, a new rule/offense is added to keep them there, "...he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life (3:22)". (The rule/offense is that to become a god a person must do an *unforgivable sin* against civilization to get "saved" [I'll write more about later, it keeps them silent...].)

***Genesis 4:(She Said, Rest for creating new Family i.e. "getting saved"):*** (`Since the Jews keep heaven [the great Jewish two system] always silent, confusion keeps growing in the second side and they end up creating a second heaven.`) Eve is the God here and Cain, Abel, and Seth are probably associates of Eve rather than born (her kin would already have heavenly inclusion). Cain and Abel try to bribe Eve with "fruits" and "fat-portions" so that they can get to heaven. Eve tries to do heaven like she saw the men do before her and encourages men to be diviners. She too curses her male subjects like the "god"" before her did (Gen 3) to "save" them. She also gives Cain protection, "...anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance *seven* times over." She banishes Cain to the East of Eden going directly against the rule where the "god" before put "cherubim and a flaming sword" as advice.\
---***Female, Rest and Family, Saving***

***Genesis 5***: Is a legend or general trends.

***Genesis 7***: Noah was part of a process that rewarded a large number of desperate men (in syncronicity) to "flood" the *earth* (and put the a*n*imals on the Ark). ("Flooding" = "divining to get higher".)

* Only Adam got out of Eden--because only he was a diviner.
* The serpeant encouraged selfishness.
* For a more straight-forward description on what the flood is read the [History of Egypt, Chaldæa, Syria, Babylonia, and Assyria, Volume 3](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17323) (skip to "Men in the mean time became wicked"); it is also available on [LibriVox](https://librivox.org/history-of-egypt-chaldea-syria-babylonia-and-assyria-vol-3-by-gaston-maspero/) on Section 5. I also put backups [here](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AvLA1bEaFFRxgtMFQBrd6Xcw9tteqA?e=qo9kGy)]

## Her Story---Second Heaven Creation/Golden Ages---♀-led, familial, submissive

![](images/eras-of-civilization_03_gold.svg) From Genesis 1:1 to Genesis 2:2, work to rest: "on the *seventh* day [s]he rested from all his work." They were fruitful and multiplied: (Gen 2) Adam and Eve; (Gen 4) Cain, Abel, Seth; and (Gen 6) "human beings began to increase in number on the earth...". They were "*beautiful*" and would live “…hundred and *twenty* years” (Gen 6:2-3).

Eve in her God era (the sweetie) thinks men too are diviners and puts Cain, Abel, and Seth up there (East of Eden, a different heaven?!).

## Heaven Creation: A Male-Ruled, Discrete, Inclusion

These religions are about getting to heaven (heaven on earth). Both religions get to heaven (the Christians mostly ignorantly) by rewarding a desperate man (man originally). The first person rewarded a desperate man and got to heaven, the second person listened to the first person and rewarded a desperate man. The Hebrews rewarded the desperate men so much that the beginning of the Bible refers to a desperate man as a "*God*", "God created the Heavens and the Earth (Gen 1:1)". To a desperate man building "Heaven on Earth" is such an attraction that it is what Adam and Noah did. Adam took the "forbidden fruit" to get out of Eden (Eden = Earth) and Noah rewarded a large number of desperate men (in synchronicity) to flood the Earth (when people became suspicious of heaven). With floods the Hebrews learned they could encourage many people to be *selfish* and hide heaven. Rule became generally male-based. The reacting to a natural environment began to be lost/forgotten. (A desperate man eventually became a diviner (always willing to take more; worried about competition?)).

> Because you simply came before me, oh god, I will give to you so that I may be like you and get higher from it.

## The Lands of Milk and Honey---Part 1 (Conquerors, The Empire Strikes Back, and Abdication/Making-Room-For-Number-One)

The Hebrews found a way to usually survive and likely thrive with the "Secret of Heaven" so they began to populate the area. The Bible describes these \[approaches/encounters\] as male \[routings/invasions\]. Abram took the religion from Chaldea to Canaan (modern-area Israel).

Eventually with Moses it ends up in Egypt (the name of the location is just Hebrew code) where it fails. The people of Egypt deny Moses his flood and Moses has to force his way out of Egypt. While they are stranded in the desert a female affectation begins. When Moses is on the mountain the golden calf appears and people appear to like it. Egypt has affected their religion and Moses (the Hebrews) react badly to it. Basically put: only males can be gods. So the Hebrews do what they always have done when in trouble: divine and get higher. By Moses bringing the 10 commandments down the mountain he is redefining the *Hebrew* definition to now be the *Jews*. The female leaders failed to recognize the separation even to this day.

## Second Heaven Creation (Getting "Saved"): A Female-Ruled, Ignorance-is-Bliss, Exclusion (conservative, more desperate)

(It is going to be hard to believe that "getting saved" is exclusion, but it is---heaven can hardly be heaven if everybody was included.)

Heaven is a Jewish belief-system and is male-led. The females have always misunderstood what heaven is. The fortunate females have gleaned off it and were allowed to join a staging ground to heaven (golden-calf, golden idols...). By Second Samuel heavenly appreciation grows when Bathsheba got to marry King David. Bathsheba was from Eden and was a *desperate female*. She was only married because she was "beautiful". Their son was Solomon and he became king when David died. From the inherited wealth of his father Solomon built many female-supported items: gold-columns, bronze statues... (1 Kings 10).

The female side of Heaven, the second group, the right, gets noticeably conservative/combative by the book of Job. Job, who is in Eden, is being helped by his wife (who is safe in heaven). Satan visits and Bathsheba abandons Job to stay safe, "Everything he has is in your power (Job 1:10-12)." She became selfish because another flood is happening. Following this the wife's family, friends continue her sin on Job and get protection for themselves (Job 1:15-19) (I call these Jobisms). Job was made a sacrifice (for possibly as long as fifty years) until the right get power again. When they get power again, The wife saves Job feeling guilty; she gives him "twice as much as he had before (Job 42:10)". Giving people as sacrifices starts here with the female-led side of Heaven. The *right* for the rest of the Old Testament develop god mythically as a spiritual being. (They have little idea they are part of heaven!?). (The desperate men, later in the Old Testament, are named a*N*gels and a head angel as Satan (Job 1:6 NIV).)

When the *New Testament* is published (the Vulgate, circa 400 A.D.) the right, now the Christian Church, makes a discernable split from the Jews. The New Testament forces four historical changes: 1) an advertisement of the value of supreme sacrifices (e.g. Job and Jesus ^[John 3:16 describes the messiahs well, "\[a\] begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have *everlasting life*."]); 2) an allowance to have sacrifices as babies (MT 2:1-4); 3) a combativeness to begin creating their own angels; and 4) a directive that salvation can come from spirituality alone (e.g. Paul).

* the Magi (or commonly called the Three Wise Men) common misnomer comes from this passage?
* A physical representation of how these societies formed has already been mapped---to see it, combine the two symbols above.

## Female Heaven Creation---a Female-Ruled Exclusion

Job's wife becomes desperate and when another flood is happening and heaven is satiated, his wife excludes to keep heavenly recognition. She sacrifices Job and her family, friends... continue her sin against Job so that they can get "saved" (I call these sins Jobisms). Somewhere along here these Jobisms get labeled good because some wanted to believe them so. When around fifty years of the flood pass and many Jobisms the females are given a golden age, fifty years of rest. By the time of Jesus sacrifices has become a planned sacrifices---a sacrifice that can begin as a baby. By 400 A.D. when the *New Testament* is published the feminine-led side of heaven becomes a greater polarity from the Jews. The Jews get zero response when they ask, "We already settled this in the Old Testament!?".

## The Lands of Milk and Honey---Conquerors, Part 2

When the Roman Empire comes, sacrifices (messiahs) begin to get created in large numbers. The Romans themselves are largely naïve. This naiveté has always got the Jew's desperates excited and the Jews themselves protection and wealth. Instead the conquerors become the conquered. The Jewish selfish-system invades into Rome---the new land of Milk and Honey. The Roman Empire breaks up from the inside-out. The new land after that is the German empire---the Roman conquerors. Just before WWII when Germany became satiated with Jews and a tolerance wears thin the Jew move to Amerika in large numbers (a have a source for this?).

Through all this until today, the right has remained largely naïve. Getting saved is the reward (or even avoiding the Jews) rather than civilization development. Their knowledge is basic: 2 is legit, 3 is illegitimate, that getting "saved" is the answer, that the things the right gives to the Jews got back better things (companies, symbols, partnerships...), and that "never again" (Gen 9:11) will we allow floods, etc.. After fifty years of this bad behavior by the right, again and again, they will be rewarded by the Jews and they will get their golden age. Their perspective has them build a safety by forcing a status quo in the golden age, that only makes the Gentiles more naïve (exactly what the left wants). And after fifty years of a golden age the disgruntled, desperate men will complain to the super-healthy Jews of the frivolous women and companies that get sued... and a new flood will be started (akin to circa 1970: Bugs in the Nixon White House, and [end of the golden age in Hollywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tate%E2%80%93LaBianca_murders)).

![](images/eras-of-civilization_04_jews.svg) The "With such bad behavior, what am I to do with it?" is what the Jews appear to say. The Jobisms continue to this day... they are called at times "have to do bad to do good". The right has taken over many aspects of heaven creation: messiah creation, angel creation, and muck control. To me it looks like "aiming to please", to the right they believe that controlling every aspect of evil creation will give them the power they finally need to win their battle.

## The Story of the Moral

* If we fail to go through it together, evolve together, the revolutions continue. These Jobisms truly only help those that do them. Right: forcing their way in. **Socially necessary information** never again *cycle of poverty*.
* 50 years right has always thought that giving to left will reach satiation ([American Made](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3532216/))
* Creating gods -- He and She God competition, battle of the fatfaces, good for the people that are part of the battle.
* Vegetarian importance---odd to the new---respect for all life can get us to Eden again.
* complicit
* A desperate man being constantly rewarded builds in time an insularity where more abnormal feelings are required for him to find things interesting. And from this insularity his behavior begins to wear on civilization's standards. He becomes so immobile that when the Hebrews say to "fear God"... this is what they mean.

## Who Am I? ^[[Git](https://github.com/EdenWise/hjcrc) \| [@](mailto:toddpartridge@outlook.com)]

I apologize for having to bring forward such a tough topic. There is a battle going on. It really is more of a grabbing of power by those failing to realize others are being left behind---the male versus female gods (very literally). When lacking helping those that need it most, gods develop. The gods use the desperates and the beauties as tools/pawns to progress their side of heaven. The desperates and beauties get rewarded falsely (lacking earning it) to be used as vessels for that progress. The Jews who organize it have safety, the gods do too, their desperates and beauties have safety (as long as the gods chose to do so), but the people left behind in Eden have to live in the [wastelands] and as political tools. Some people of Eden are even designated sacrifices, like Jesus. It may be hard to believe but I am one of these people. Us messiahs have zero story that gets recorded, have zero story to learn from, and are used by the right as sacrifices to create their side of heaven (like Job). The female gods have lacked wanting to deal with the male gods and are submissive so they have learned that by giving up sacrifices like Job and Jesus that they get power too. I am one of these people. And this is hardly a short story, I have been here all my life. I have seen some other sacrifices in my life journey and these stories are too disturbing to talk about. I wonder what type of faith to have in all this. It has been this way for 4100 years. I feel truly alone and have zero idea if there will ever be any representation for us. Zero people in my life story have I discovered that truly know what is going on.

The battle in heaven produces a selfish splitting of safety. The saved (ignorant or known) have a protective buffer. This buffer causes a general conservatism and when in danger conservatisms grows into artifice. The saved feel it is more about avoiding the Jews than to listening to those that need it the most, the poor. We are all from Eden. The people of Eden, bound to nature, see conservatisms as selfish and artifices as dangerous. Our realities are surrounded in fear. People are being forced to be saved. Flood push people to be selfish/heaven. After 4100 years of them a general behavior of self-positioning exists.

## Notes

* Introduction:
  * Define as zero-sum game? godhead? 
  * What is heaven? It has come to following the free---a gravity almost all are being pulled to---generally ignorantly. A safety. Can anyone see it clearly.
  * These religions are about getting "saved".
+ The saved, the right, feel it is more about fighting or avoiding the Jews than listening to the poor, or getting an overview, or getting back to Eden.
+ Grand Mistresses/Masters say "It hardly matters how you get here".
+ Those that follow the great two-ism live rich lives---an algorithm invested in heavily by both sides---the great two algorithmic clock.
+ Some people join these societies thinking they will help from there---going through it together is nature's answer.
+ *Satan says, "It is easy to get people to be selfish." (Job ??:??)*
+ "[A heavenly person] must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat, and live forever" (Gen 3:22-24). Paraphrase: "Gods/saved-people are prevented (by some great magical force?) from returning to Eden."---the Bible states this as-if absolute fact.
+ The Right, the Christians, have assumed most of: angel creation, muck maintenance, Jewish-satisfaction/aims-to-please.
+ The temerity of the right---sacrifices, baby sacrifices, zero full-view, conservatism, saved, rewarding naïve spiritualism, feeders of the left, ignorance is bliss, and thinking they have won when given a golden age (or failing to realize status quo ["never again" Gen 9:11]). These become people that are enticed.
+ Answers that come from the top/heaven/the-gods provide safety in the immediacy rather than knowledge that is built naturally/socially over time.
+ John Nash and zerosum game (important)
+ Esther: Where is the five discriminating?
+ Gods invest in two; Edenites invest in one (nature).
+ Heavenly Sins: 1) Protecting gods first and answers come from the saved; 2) Disappearing as an answer; 3) Eden as expendable/erasable and 4) Beauty as value.
+ Eight abandoned by Jews, now a red herring. The right has claimed it as theirs [7 ;)] and hides behind it. Combative right also using it to label Jewish businesses with. It lacks being fair because they have more numbers.
+ Bad behavior feeds them!
+ Paradise Lost.
+ Heaven is a Pavlovian system that is running away from nature. The rewards outweigh the known/felt consequences.
+ ♪ Do I need your civil war? It feeds the rich while it buries the poor. ♪
+ Empathy: sharing a similar feeling because of a similar threat.
+ Saved-people/gods... your perspective is going to give you divisiveness simply by position. By default we want to be righteous, good with nature and others—--only an equal perspective can accomplish that. To help, perspectives like "beauty" and "being saved" need to be left behind.
+ From an honest perspective it is easier to learn that hardness and softness are hardly male and female attributes. Really, they are because the first side (the Jews) got to exercise the Secret of Heaven (and flood) and felt its production and protection (by audacity); while the second side, starting with the wives, inherited the protection, and learned submissiveness/conservativeness as a way to survive.
+ Safety (as in from heaven, a perspective above nature) breeds conservativeness. Both the Jews and the Right behave so. This conservativeness effects the people [left behind] and puts them in greater danger.
+ If we do a thing that fails-to-prioritize-those-that-need-it-most/is-selfish civilizations/herds make us feel guilty---survival requires us to move together as one. If we fail to provide that feeling what astronomical number of fixes would be have to begin to fix?
+ We have to go through evolution all together else we will become ignorant of the people left behind.
+ Deperates, How Did They Become So? They need confidence so much and focus entirely on themselves (narcissistic/self-absorbed)---other needs they fail to realize as necessary.
+ Seeing Edenites, naive people, gets the angels excited, and the Jews a feeling of free. Edenites have closer ties to nature and are kept from knowing that others have chosen "heaven on earth" (whether right or left) to get themselves above them. The first side/gods divine and put Edenites in a lower class during the flood, the second side/gods largely ignore them or sin against the Edenites as an offering to regain control after the flood (oops). The second side lacking knowing the great two-ism put us Edenites in increasingly worse danger. Such naivete of the Edenites got the Jews [confident] in such a way that these bugs were built in 1968! The Jews have become very Pavlonian, guided by the rewards. The only answer is to keep from feeding them. The people that need the most support, us Edenites, would really appreciate it (♥ free will).
+ The New Testament occurred at a time of a lot of turmoil (the Roman occupation, another flood). Many messiahs were created (Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth, Reza Aslan)---Paul being the foremost, as a baby! (i.e. Paul was likely the lead person they used to create the messiah policy.) Paul choose to avoid heaven I believe (e.g. the three temptations in the wilderness [MT 4:1-11, Luke 4:1-13]) and stayed a part of Eden a good part of his life---even during the "golden age" (in Zealot). The second side had to deal with Paul, his ethics, and it would have been work for them. This [closed the gap] in the Jewish dualism that took 400 years to find an amendable policy---the New Testament, the Christian Church, which agreed to act on people like Paul. The policy: gave fealty to the Jews (MT 1), agreed to provide sacrifices (with some being babies) (MT 2:1-4); and said that those that believe in Jesus (and people like Paul) as sacrifices were absolved of sin. Jerusalem got renamed Aelia Capitolina as part of the turmoil. (This is important history that few know.)
* "They made me do it (the left)"---false; began with Job, started by right.
* Section: Beauty Myth. Right built upon beauty methodology: vain, superficial, guilt avoiding.
* Section: Misnomers/Relabeling (6,3)--- errors by both heavens. Attributing heavens actions as Eden's: huge sin.
* The two shapes put together form the Star of David... a physical representation about how these societies formed.
* The battle of the right has become absolutely vicious and scares the people forsaken.
* The angels/beauties gotten-away-with-behavior make the rules (if endorsed by the Jews).
* The Jews behavior represents some their angel's behavior. They enjoy/need the visceral that is absent in their safety.
* The left-right heavens a powerful partnership/godhead. Only the Jews know this. Angels like David and Bathsheba made that protection by their recklessnesses.
* Nature is being neglected.
* Golden Ages appear great, but warning, a status quo is forced and they make the Gentiles even more naïve.
* Saved people, by their protection, feel righteous and superficial answers look more attactive to avoid guilt.
* The flood makes people selfish and the openness of the top of the food chain makes self-judging an open temptation.
* Bible chronological, almost perfectly!
* Kafka stating Jewish intent to go to Amerika, Jews define their intent
* Grand Master Leonardo da Vinci: Mona Lisa smiling, Adoration of the Magi, sacred feminine, Knights Templar.
* An example today of answers from the top can be seen in the principle of trickle-*down* economics and Adam Smiths Wealth of Nations.
* Messianic definition: John 3:16.
* Safety: an ideal. Have it for a bit and it feels normal---the feeling that makes heaven.
* Right Recruitment Requirements: 1) A battle must be declared on the Jews, and 2) that the modus operandi of this battle is bad behavior/building sin.
* Temptations create Gods and corruption.
* "May old acquaintance, be forgot..." Most suicides happen on New Years Eve (yearly flood begins here).
* Svg_jews: 1 to 11! Ruth going to Judah.
* Jack Weiner in Marion Ross book "My Days" said (paraphrase) "Use my name in any way you like".
* Jewish self-interest appears to say, "With such bad behavior, what am I to do with it".
* David began listening to Bathsheba more when she gave up Job? As a rewardee it took more abnormal subjects to interest him!
* gods avoid natural reminders to make them behave.
* To Eden, to us, it feels like a battle on the threes.
* Lacking knowing what was going on Bathsheba started off pretty bad. Desperate she used beauty as an "in". Being separated by her husbands safety/being-a-rewardee she helped created Solomon as a puppet(her own son) as an a confirmation of her aptitude.
* mortal/immortal
* Heaven become too obvious.
* Jealously/submissiveness was created in the women/second-group?---only Adam got out of Eden. **w**-**o**-man.
* Visceral, Vicarious
* For the first fifty years, the first group, men mainly, the Jews, reward those who implement "Secret of Heaven" tasks (*rewardees*). For the following fifty years, the second group, the female-led group, the less knowledgeable but still protected group (their wives and other self-deserving people), are allowed the rule and they reward *resting* and guess at how to implement "Secret of Heaven" tasks (even get misdirected) while the Jews try to keep a status quo. The result of the second group fifty-year rule ends up making [laypeople] who have little heavenly knowledge, are naïve, and are exploitable/susceptible. Then the whole cycle is restarted again where the first group *rewardees* are excited by the naïveté of the [laypeople] who are often taken advantage of and used as tools in this battle. I am older and have seen a large number of poor people being used as them---the prescribed fix is desultory and ultimately selfish.
* The Jews create a hole in the bottom of society. They get [leverage] from it. They do this by working against the least fortunate people. This has ended up causing the second side to fight a battle with the Jews rather to defend Job, Jesus... (For a long time now the last thing anyone is to do is defend Job.) This mis-prioritizing is exactly what the Jews want: hate them, think the golden age is yours, but the last thing to do is to help Job get a meal today.
* The Grand Masters/Mistresses say, "It hardly matters how you get here" but what they are really saying is that (for most of us) there will come a time that the rewards of joining will outweigh the consequences of joining. Tiny steps of personal safety will add up over time.
* Sin is used as a commodity in this system.
* Artifice is being used to create immortality.
* Narcisstics=Desperates
* A very limited number of Jews know what is going on (know heaven and know the rules).
* Christians your predecessors are the Jews! You are the near-sighted second side. Your bad behavior keeps the poor away!
* What gets a right-winger Grand-Mistress/Master more riled than ethics??
* The right joining in the flood (Gen 6) is hardly part of the great two! So we will rest during a male era to fix the great two (Gen 9).
* The Christian's messiahs are put in almost inevitable death situations. Since the Jews go as far as to say that men are natural diviners (Gen 4: Eve being supported for putting Cain, Abel, and Seth there from Eden) the Christians labeling some men as sacrifices (carpenters, walkers on water...) their fates are sure and preferrably ignorable.
* When a messiah (a sacrifice) learns about a heavenly rule then the Gods work directly against him and change the rule (divine and get higher).
* Jobisms: are a great fix now that cause horrible problems later (god fix).
* Jobisms: the right, wanting to believe that Jobisms were good, began telling themselves (*or were led*), that the Jobisms earned them the golden ages.
* The "unforgivable" societal sin that gets people "saved" has the sad effect of changing the doers focus, the focus from compunction for the people that have been sinned of to "anger" toward the Jews. The anger/energy put there adds to the problem---they are your predecessors.
* The left incites the right---makes them battle the left.
* - Desperate females were eventually given their own rule---part of the great Jewish TWO system.
- In nature a species one-ness, always looking out for itself, is key to its survival. Its lack of being noticed by humans (who are at the top of the food chain) has been almost entirely invisible. Few people who are saved (though many may lack knowing they have this protection \[yet on the radar, or someone else is protecting them\]) will be put in a horrible fate where they will be forced to pay attention to what has been left behind and will carry the weight of societies burden. But little fortitude has been seen by me because zero people have accepted that quiet/invisible forces have encouraged them to unknown selfishness. This selfishness manifests itself in pride; that power feels much better responsibility that they may be part of privilege... Eden still exists... barely... in a frayed, manifestations in rare moments, way. ![](images/hear-see-speak-zero-evil.svg) ![](images/jewish-code.svg)
